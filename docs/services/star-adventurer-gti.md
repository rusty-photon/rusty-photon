# Star Adventurer GTi Service

## Overview

The `star-adventurer-gti` service is an ASCOM Alpaca Telescope driver for the
Sky-Watcher Star Adventurer GTi German Equatorial Mount. It speaks the
[Sky-Watcher motor-controller command set] over either USB-CDC serial or WiFi
(UDP/11880) — the same wire protocol on both transports — and exposes the
mount as an ASCOM Telescope for any Alpaca-compatible client (NINA, SGPro,
`rp`, etc.).

The driver implements the subset of `ITelescopeV3` that the rusty-photon
ecosystem actually needs (slew, sync, track, park, abort, side-of-pier,
PulseGuide), plus the standard device metadata. MoveAxis, custom
tracking rates, and polar-alignment helpers are explicitly deferred
(see [§MVP Scope](#mvp-scope)).

```

The wire protocol is the same on both transports — the [Sky-Watcher
motor-controller command set] §6 (Wi-Fi Connection) is explicit that the
WiFi adapter / built-in WiFi module simply runs a UDP server on port 11880
and accepts the same `:cmd<axis><payload>\r` frames the serial port does.
Empirically verified on this mount in both modes.

### Crate vs service boundary

Protocol logic lives in the `skywatcher-motor-protocol` crate (under
`crates/`); transport, polling, state, and ASCOM mapping live in the
service. The crate is pure (no I/O, no async, no ASCOM types) so it is
miri-clean and trivially property-testable.

| Component | Crate (`skywatcher-motor-protocol`) | Service (`star-adventurer-gti`) |
|---|---|---|
| Frame encode (`Command` → `Vec<u8>`) | ✓ | |
| Frame decode (`&[u8]` → `Response` / `ProtocolError`) | ✓ | |
| 24-bit LE nibble-pair hex codec | ✓ | |
| 0x800000 position-bias add/subtract | ✓ | |
| Mount-error-code → `ProtocolError` | ✓ | |
| Async I/O (serial, UDP) | | ✓ |
| Polling loop, state machine | | ✓ |
| ASCOM trait implementation | | ✓ |
| RA/Dec ↔ encoder-tick math | | ✓ |
| Local-sidereal-time computation | | ✓ |
| Mount-side parameter discovery (`:a`, `:b`, `:g`) | | ✓ |

The crate is intentionally not Sky-Watcher-mount-specific beyond the wire
format: it does not know about RA/Dec, ASCOM, or any particular mount's
gear ratios. A future `az-gti` service or any other mount that speaks this
protocol could reuse the crate verbatim.

### Shared transport (Phase E of issue #257)

The connection lifecycle — refcounted multi-client open/close, handshake,
background poll task, request arbitration lock — lives in the workspace
crate `rusty-photon-shared-transport` (`crates/rusty-photon-shared-transport/`).
The service plugs into it via:

* **`SkywatcherCodec`** (`src/codec.rs`) — implements
  [`rusty_photon_shared_transport::Codec`]. The codec's `Response`
  type is the raw `Vec<u8>` frame; per-command typed decoding lives in
  [`MountManager::send`] and the handshake hook, because the Sky-Watcher
  protocol's success-body interpretation depends on the originating
  command (a 6-hex-byte body decodes as `Response::U24` for `:a` but
  as `Response::Position` for `:j`).
* **`SerialTransportFactory`** / **`UdpTransportFactory`** (`src/transport/{serial,udp}.rs`)
  — `TransportFactory` impls that hand back `Box<dyn FrameTransport>`s
  configured with `\r` framing on serial or one-datagram-per-frame on
  UDP. Selection at `ServerBuilder::build()` time picks one based on
  `config.transport`. The same `UdpFrameTransport` adapter from the
  shared crate preserves the mount's "exactly one frame per packet"
  framing strictness.
* **`MountManager`** (`src/manager.rs`) — thin wrapper around
  `Arc<SharedTransport<SkywatcherCodec>>`, plus the mount-specific
  parameter cache (`MountParameters`), background snapshot
  (`MountSnapshot`), and `PollPauseGuard` ref-counted polling-task
  pause. The handshake (`:F`/`:a`/`:b`/`:g`/`:e`/`:j`) and the
  poll-loop (`:j`/`:f`) live in `Hooks` closures inside
  `MountManager::new`, alongside two teardown hooks: `on_last_disconnect`
  issues the best-effort halt sequence (`:L1`, `:L2`, `:K1`) every time the
  last Alpaca client disconnects — in service-lifetime mode the transport
  stays open, so the parameter cache is retained — and `shutdown` runs the
  same sequence once at service shutdown before the transport drops,
  additionally clearing the parameter cache.

The device's session lives in `MountDevice::session:
RwLock<Option<Session<SkywatcherCodec>>>` — the slot's presence is the
single source of truth for "the user is connected" (the pre-Phase-E
`requested_connection` bool was removed). Watcher tasks (slew, park,
pulse-guide) acquire their own sessions on spawn so the user's
`set_connected(false)` returns immediately after closing the device's
session — the watcher's session keeps the underlying transport open
until it finishes naturally. Watchers peek at the device's session
slot (briefly, no wire I/O under the read lock) to detect "user
disconnected" and bail.

## Hardware Constraints

The Star Adventurer GTi is a portable German Equatorial Mount with a
counterweight bar. Two control paths from the host:

- **USB-CDC** (USB-C on the mount). Enumerates as `/dev/ttyACM*`
  (Linux), `/dev/cu.usbmodem*` (macOS), or `COM*` (Windows). The vendor
  spec says **9600 8N1**; in practice the GTi USB also accepts
  **115200 baud**, which we recommend (matches EQMOD documentation and
  is faster). Use the stable `/dev/serial/by-id/...` symlink rather
  than `/dev/ttyACM0` — the unsuffixed device path can shuffle on
  reboot when other USB-CDC peripherals (PPBA, focuser, etc.) are
  present.
- **WiFi** (built-in, AP mode by default). The mount self-hosts an open
  access point and listens on **UDP/11880** at `192.168.4.1`. Same
  protocol; one command per UDP packet, one response per UDP packet.
  The host **must bind the local socket to a 192.168.4.x source
  address** explicitly — relying on the kernel to pick a source IP
  fails when there is a competing default route, and the mount
  silently drops packets it can't reply to.

Mount-side parameters are queried at connect time rather than hard-coded:

| Parameter | Command | Typical GTi value | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|
| Counts per revolution (per axis) | `:a1` / `:a2` | RA `0x375F00` = 3,628,800; Dec `0x2C4C00` = 2,903,040 (the axes differ — hardware-measured) | encoder-tick ↔ angle conversion |
| Timer-interrupt frequency | `:b1` | `0xF42400` ≈ 16 MHz | step-period (T1 preset) calculation |
| High-speed ratio | `:g1` / `:g2` | mount-specific (e.g. 16, 32, 64) | high-speed-slew step-period scaling |
| Motor board version | `:e1` | `0x03300C` (mount type 0x03, fw v0x30.0x0C) | mount-family detection (EQ vs AZ), **and identity gate** (see [§Initialisation sequence](#initialisation-sequence)) |

CPR varies between the GTi's RA and Dec axes and between firmware
revisions; the driver reads both rather than assuming.

The protocol exposes **no native park position** and **no site lat/lon**.
We implement software park (target encoder pair sourced from config,
or — failing that — the live snapshot after the
`unpark_from_ap_position` encoder seed, see
[§Park lifecycle](#park-lifecycle), [§Park persistence](#park-persistence),
and [§Unpark from AP position](#unpark-from-ap-position)) and require
site lat/lon in the config (see
[§ASCOM Telescope Mapping](#ascom-telescope-mapping)).

## Protocol Reference

The motor-controller protocol is a request/response ASCII protocol with
unusual hex encoding and a position-bias convention. Both are easy to get
wrong and both are codec-layer concerns the crate isolates.

### Frame format

```
Command:    : <cmd> <axis> <payload?> \r           1–9 bytes
Response:   = <payload?>                  \r       1–8 bytes  (success)
Response:   ! <2-hex-errcode>             \r       4 bytes    (error)
```

- `<cmd>` is one ASCII letter (case-sensitive). Uppercase = setter / motion
  command; lowercase = inquiry.
- `<axis>` is `'1'` (RA / Az motor), `'2'` (Dec / Alt motor), or `'3'`
  (both axes — only valid for some commands).
- `<payload>` is 1–6 ASCII hex bytes (`'0'`–`'9'`, `'A'`–`'F'`). Empty for
  payload-less commands.
- All frames terminate with a single `\r` (`0x0D`). **No `\n`.** UDP
  responses do include a trailing `\r`.
- If the controller sees a second `:` before `\r`, it discards the partial
  frame and starts fresh — useful for resync after a corrupted packet.

### UDP framing strictness

When the transport is UDP, framing is unforgiving (empirically verified on
the GTi):

| Variant | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `:e1\r` | reply received |
| `:e1\r\n` | reply received (trailing `\n` tolerated) |
| `:e1` (no `\r`) | silent — controller waits for terminator |
| `:e1\r` + trailing zero-padding | silent — extra bytes after `\r` reject the packet |
| `\xff…:e1\r` (junk-prefixed) | silent — bytes before `:` reject the packet |

The codec must enforce: exactly one well-formed frame per UDP packet,
nothing trailing.

### Hex encoding (24-bit data — low byte first, nibbles in order)

For the 24-bit value `0x123456`, the wire bytes are ASCII
`"5" "6" "3" "4" "1" "2"` — i.e., low byte first, with each byte's nibbles
in normal high-then-low order.

```
0x123456  →  bytes 0x56, 0x34, 0x12  →  ASCII "56" "34" "12"
                                      →  "563412"
```

This is the source of the most common implementation bug; the codec
exposes typed `encode_u24` / `decode_u24` (and `_i24`) helpers and the
service is forbidden from rolling its own hex translation.

### Position-bias offset 0x800000

Axis positions are conveyed with a fixed bias of `0x800000` to keep them
unsigned on the wire while permitting signed-positive and signed-negative
encoder counts:

| Encoder count (true) | Wire value |
|---|---|
| `0` | `0x800000` |
| `+1` | `0x800001` |
| `-1` | `0x7FFFFF` |
| `+0x1234` | `0x801234` |
| `-0x1234` | `0x7FEDCC` |

The codec subtracts on decode and adds on encode; service code sees
signed-`i32` encoder counts only.

### Error codes

| Code | Name | ASCOM mapping |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | UnknownCommand | `INVALID_OPERATION` (programmer error, log) |
| `1` | CommandLengthError | `INVALID_OPERATION` (programmer error, log) |
| `2` | MotorNotStopped | `INVALID_OPERATION` |
| `3` | InvalidCharacter | `INVALID_OPERATION` (programmer error, log) |
| `4` | NotInitialized | propagate as transport error; driver re-issues `:F` |
| `5` | DriverSleeping | propagate; user must re-power mount |
| `7` | PECTrainingRunning | `INVALID_OPERATION` (PEC out of MVP scope) |
| `8` | NoValidPECData | `INVALID_OPERATION` (PEC out of MVP scope) |

### Initialisation sequence

After opening the transport and before the first motion command:

1. `:e1` → **identity gate**. Decode as
   [`skywatcher_motor_protocol::Response::U24`]; the high byte must be a
   known Sky-Watcher mount-type ID (see
   [`MountType::from_motor_board_version`][mount-type]). On any other
   reply (framing malformed, payload wrong shape, mount-type byte
   outside the whitelist) the driver aborts the handshake with
   [`StarAdvError::WrongDevice`][wrong-device] *before* sending
   anything else — the wrong device sees exactly one frame (`:e1\r`).
2. `:F1` → expect `=\r` (Initialize axis 1)
3. `:F2` → expect `=\r` (Initialize axis 2)
4. `:a1` → record RA-axis CPR
5. `:a2` → record Dec-axis CPR
6. `:b1` → record TMR_Freq
7. `:g1` → record RA-axis high-speed ratio
8. `:g2` → record Dec-axis high-speed ratio
9. `:j1` / `:j2` → record initial encoder positions

Steps 4-9 seed the in-memory mount-parameters cache used by the
coordinate module and the slew planner. The motor-board-version reply
from step 1 is also cached (`MountParameters::motor_board_version`)
for diagnostic logging.

**Why `:e1` is first** (issue #254): the 2026-05-17 San Diego hardware
session pointed the driver at `/dev/serial/...` for a QHY focuser by
mistake. The pre-fix handshake had already sent seven mount-specific
commands (`:F1`, `:F2`, `:a1`, `:a2`, `:b1`, `:g1`, `:g2`) to the wrong
device before reaching the identity check at step 8. Reordering so
`:e1` is first and strictly-validated bounds the wrong-device blast
radius to a single innocuous inquiry, and the ASCOM error surfaced to
the operator names the configured port plus the wrong-device
hypothesis (see [`StarAdvError::WrongDevice`][wrong-device]'s `Display`
shape).

### Commands used by the MVP

| Command | Purpose | MVP usage |
|---|---|---|
| `:E<axis><pos24>` | Set axis position (sync) | implements `SyncToCoordinatesAsync` |
| `:F<axis>` | Initialize axis | connect handshake |
| `:G<axis><mode2>` | Set motion mode (Goto/Tracking, fast/slow, dir, etc.) | every slew, every track-state change |
| `:H<axis><inc24>` | Set goto-target by increment (magnitude; sign from `:G` CCW) | every slew (INDI-style sequence) |
| `:M<axis><breaks24>` | Set goto break-point increment | every slew (INDI-style sequence) |
| `:S<axis><pos24>` | Set goto absolute target | `Park` only (target is encoder 0) |

## ASCOM Telescope Mapping

Every property/method on `ITelescopeV3`, what the driver returns, and why.

### Capability flags

| Flag | Value | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `AlignmentMode` | `GermanPolar` | GTi is a true GEM with counterweight; meridian-flip semantics apply |
| `EquatorialSystem` | `Topocentric` | Driver convention; the wire protocol is epoch-agnostic, and topocentric matches what host planning code (rp) is wired for |
| `CanSlew` | `true` | implemented |
| `CanSlewAsync` | `true` | implemented (non-blocking; poll `Slewing`) |
| `CanSlewAltAz` | `false` | RA/Dec only in MVP |
| `CanSlewAltAzAsync` | `false` | RA/Dec only in MVP |
| `CanSync` | `true` | implemented via `:E` |
| `CanSyncAltAz` | `false` | RA/Dec only in MVP |
| `CanSetTracking` | `true` | implemented (sidereal only) |
| `CanSetTrackingRate` | `false` | sidereal only in MVP |
| `CanSetRightAscensionRate` | `false` | custom rates deferred |
| `CanSetDeclinationRate` | `false` | custom rates deferred |
| `CanSetGuideRates` | `true` | implemented (`GuideRateRightAscension` / `GuideRateDeclination` are independently settable in deg/sec, defaulting to `0.5 × sidereal`) |
| `CanPulseGuide` | `true` | implemented as rate-shifted tracking (see [§PulseGuide lifecycle](#pulseguide-lifecycle)) |
| `CanMoveAxis(any)` | `false` | manual slew deferred |
| `CanFindHome` | `false` | no hardware home position |
| `CanPark` | `true` | implemented (software park) |
| `CanUnpark` | `true` | implemented |
| `CanSetPark` | effectively `true` by default | The driver now always resolves a config-file path at startup (the `--config <path>` argument if given, else the platform config dir — see [§Device identity (UniqueID)](#device-identity-uniqueid)), so it always has a path to persist `SetPark` writes to. At the library layer `CanSetPark` still keys on whether a config path was supplied to `MountDevice`; only `MountDevice::new` (no path) reports `false`, which the binary never does. See [§Park persistence](#park-persistence) |
| `CanSetPierSide` | runtime-determined | `true` when `flip_policy.enabled` is set on a hardware-validated mount; `false` otherwise (`SetSideOfPier` returns `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`). See [§Meridian flip](#meridian-flip) |
| `DoesRefraction` | `false` | mount applies no refraction model; host (rp) provides refracted coords |
| `TrackingRates` | `[Sidereal]` | sidereal only in MVP |

### Reads

| Property | Implementation |
|---|---|
| `RightAscension` | from current RA-axis encoder + LST + sync offset |
| `Declination` | from current Dec-axis encoder + sync offset |
| `Azimuth` | derived from RA/Dec + site lat/lon + LST |
| `Altitude` | derived as above |
| `TargetRightAscension` | last `SlewToCoordinatesAsync` / `SlewToTargetAsync` target; `INVALID_OPERATION` if not set |
| `TargetDeclination` | as above |
| `Slewing` | `true` while either axis status (`:f`) reports running in Goto mode; cleared when both stop |
| `Tracking` | driver-state mirror of last `Tracking` setter |
| `TrackingRate` | always `Sidereal` in MVP |
| `GuideRateRightAscension` | RA guide rate (deg/sec). In-memory mirror of the last `SetGuideRateRightAscension` write, default `0.5 × SIDEREAL_DEG_PER_SEC ≈ 0.00209` (i.e. fraction = 0.5 of sidereal). Re-initialised to the default on each `Connected = true`. |
| `GuideRateDeclination` | Dec guide rate (deg/sec). Same shape as RA; settable independently per ASCOM. |
| `IsPulseGuiding` | `true` if either axis has an in-flight pulse (`pulse_guiding.ra || pulse_guiding.dec`); see [§PulseGuide lifecycle](#pulseguide-lifecycle) for the per-axis flag semantics. |
| `AtPark` | driver-state flag; set by `Park`, cleared by `Unpark` and by any motion command |
| `AtHome` | `false` (no hardware home concept) |
| `SideOfPier` | derived from Dec-axis encoder + Dec-axis CPR + site latitude — canonical INDI eqmod convention (`PierSide::East` when `\|dec_encoder\| > cpr_dec/4`, i.e. Dec rotated past either celestial pole). Southern hemisphere inverts. See [§Side-of-pier](#side-of-pier) |
| `DestinationSideOfPier(ra, dec)` | predicts the pointing state the driver would land at for a slew target. Runs the flip-policy decision (current side + target HA + `flip_policy.enabled`), maps to encoder ticks for the chosen side, and validates the per-side safety envelope. With `flip_policy.enabled = false` always returns the current side (driver never plans a flip). See [§Side-of-pier](#side-of-pier) and [§Meridian flip](#meridian-flip) |
| `SiteLatitude` | from config (read-only; setter returns `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`) |
| `SiteLongitude` | as above |
| `SiteElevation` | from config; defaults to `0` |
| `UTCDate` | host clock (per ASCOM convention; setter writes a host-side offset only) |
| `SiderealTime` | computed from `UTCDate` + `SiteLongitude` |
| `SlewSettleTime` | from config; setter is allowed (writes the in-memory cache only, not config file) |

### Writes / methods

| Method | Implementation |
|---|---|
| `Connected = true` | acquire a session on the already-open transport (opened eagerly at service start — see [§Connection Lifecycle](#connection-lifecycle)); refcount bump, then the post-acquire hooks `seed_after_connect` (fresh-power-up AP-pose encoder seed) and `load_park_target_after_connect` run |
| `Connected = false` | release the session. On the last client disconnect, issue the `:L1`/`:L2`/`:K1` safety stop; the transport stays open and background polling continues until service shutdown |

#### Host-clock dependency for LST-using reads

`RightAscension`, `Azimuth`, `Altitude`, `SiderealTime`,
`SyncToCoordinates`, `SlewToCoordinatesAsync`, and
`DestinationSideOfPier` all compute local apparent sidereal time
from the host's `SystemTime::now()`. (`Declination` reads the
Dec encoder directly and is not LST-dependent.) The conversion
goes through ERFA (`Dtf2d` → `Utctai` → `Gst06a`), and ERFA
refuses host UTCs that `eraCal2jd` rejects — in practice a year
below `IYMIN = -4799`. The leap-second-table boundary (years
before 1960 or beyond `IYV + 5`) is reported as a *warning* in
`Utctai`, not an error, so a future-shifted clock still produces
a valid LST. When ERFA *does* refuse, the trait method returns
`INVALID_OPERATION` with a `timekeeping error: ...` payload
rather than panicking the tokio task. The slew-completion
watcher's pickup loop matches the same pattern: on ERFA failure
it logs `warn!`, clears `slew_in_progress`, and exits cleanly so
the next Alpaca client read of `Slewing` flips to `false`.

```

#### The anchored-frame rule

Whether `Park()` may slew at all is governed by whether the driver's
coordinate frame is **anchored** — whether the encoder→pose mapping
has an operator-asserted or measured ground truth. Slewing to an
absolute AP-pose target from an *unanchored* frame commands real
physical motion to a fabricated position (this moved a real mount
90°/90° out of its physical park on 2026-07-19, when a client parked
it seconds after connect). Per the workspace tenet
[*no actuation on connect*](../workspace.md#project-tenets), a mount
that doesn't know where it is must never guess with the motors.

The frame is **anchored** when any of:

- `unpark_from_ap_position` is a named park (`ap_park_1..ap_park_5`) —
  the operator asserts the power-up pose; the fresh-power-up seed (or
  the non-fresh skip, which means the frame carried over from earlier
  operations this power cycle) grounds the mapping.
- `SyncToCoordinates` / `SyncToTarget` succeeded during this
  connection (plate-solve ground truth).
- The `UnparkFromApPosition(ap_park_N)` recovery Action ran with a
  named park (operator asserts the current physical pose).

Anchoring is re-derived on every connect — a sync-derived anchor does
**not** survive disconnect (conservative: a new session cannot know
what an earlier one measured).

#### Park-target resolution

The **park-target encoder pair** is resolved per axis on every connect
(and re-resolved by `SetPreferredApPark` and by the sync that anchors
a previously unanchored frame), in this order of preference:

1. **Raw config-file override** (per axis). The driver always resolves
   a config-file path at startup (see
   [§Device identity (UniqueID)](#device-identity-uniqueid)); that file
   is re-read on every connect and `mount.park_ra_ticks` /
   `mount.park_dec_ticks` are used when present — **regardless of
   anchoring** (raw ticks are the operator's own frame assertion;
   `SetPark` writes them from a live encoder read). Per-axis: if only
   `park_ra_ticks` is set, RA comes from the file and Dec falls
   through to step 2. (At the library layer, a `MountDevice` built
   without a config path — `MountDevice::new`, unit tests only — reads
   the same fields from the in-memory `MountConfig` instead.)
2. **`preferred_ap_park` pose ticks — anchored frames only.** The
   named AP pose (ship default `ap_park_3`) converted to encoder ticks
   for the configured latitude and the handshake counts-per-revolution.
3. **No target — park in place.** With an unanchored frame and no raw
   override the axis has no park target: `Park()` stops the axis where
   it stands and sets `AtPark`. Once a sync anchors the frame the
   target is re-armed from `preferred_ap_park` and subsequent parks
   slew normally.

The ship default `unpark_from_ap_position` is `ap_park_0`: the field
is the operator's assertion about the physical world, and "current
position" is the only value that is true when nothing was asserted —
a named-pose default would seed a confidently *wrong* frame whenever
the mount powered up elsewhere, and a park would then slew to a
fabricated position. An unconfigured install therefore parks in place
and can never move wrongly. Operators with a repeatable setup declare
their power-up pose (typically `ap_park_3`, Sky-Watcher's stock home):
the fresh power-up seed then writes the encoder to that pose's values,
and with `preferred_ap_park` at the same pose (its default) the park
target is armed at those same values — so a `Park()` issued
immediately after connect (e.g. rp's safety enforcer parking on an
unsafe startup transition) is a zero-distance goto: **no motion, by
construction**.

**Roof-interlock note:** installations where a roll-off roof may only
close over a parked scope MUST use an anchored configuration (a named
`unpark_from_ap_position`, or raw `park_*_ticks`). Park-in-place is
honest about an unknown frame, but it cannot guarantee a roof-safe
pose.

Re-reading the config file on every connect means a successful
`SetPark` (or a manual operator edit between connects) takes effect on
the next reconnect without restarting the driver. After load the
in-memory target is fixed for the session unless `SetPark`,
`SetPreferredApPark`, or an anchoring sync updates it (see
[§Park persistence](#park-persistence)).

### Park persistence

`SetPark` writes the current encoder pair back into the **same JSON
config file** the driver loaded at startup. No separate state file.
Concretely:

1. **Capability gate.** The driver now always resolves a config-file
   path at startup — the `--config <path>` argument if given, else the
   platform config dir (see
   [§Device identity (UniqueID)](#device-identity-uniqueid)). That path
   is the one `SetPark` persists to, so **`CanSetPark` is effectively
   `true` by default**: park persistence works out-of-the-box, even on
   a no-arg launch. (Earlier builds gated `CanSetPark` on `--config`
   being present and left it `false` for `Config::default()` runs.)
   The library-level capability still keys on whether a config path was
   supplied to `MountDevice` — `MountDevice::new` (no path) reports
   `false` and `SetPark` returns `ASCOM_NOT_IMPLEMENTED` — but the
   binary always supplies a path, so that branch is now only reachable
   in unit tests. The capability flag is computed at startup; clients
   that cache it once per session see a stable answer.
2. **Refusal cases.** `SetPark` also refuses (`NOT_CONNECTED` /
   `INVALID_OPERATION`) when the device is disconnected or while a
   slew / park is in progress — the "current encoder pair" wouldn't be
   stable otherwise.
3. **Fresh encoder read.** The encoder pair (and the per-axis running
   flag the in-progress refusal checks) is read **live from the wire** —
   a synchronous `:j` / `:f` poll on both axes via the connected
   session — not from the background poll snapshot, which lags the wire
   by up to one `polling_interval`. Reading live means `SetPark`
   persists the true current encoder even if the operator moved the
   mount out-of-band immediately before the call, and removes a
   connect/poll timing race that made the BDD persistence scenario flaky
   on slow CI (issue #308): the eager service-start handshake seeds the
   snapshot before the test sets the encoder, and the user's connect is
   a refcount bump rather than a fresh handshake. (The write itself is
   fully `fsync`'d and atomically renamed before the call returns — see
   step 5 — so the persisted file is durable, not fire-and-forget.)
4. **Read-as-`Value`, write only park keys.** The driver reads the
   on-disk JSON via `serde_json::Value`, mutates *only*
   `mount.park_ra_ticks` and `mount.park_dec_ticks`, and serialises the
   result pretty-printed. Any field the driver doesn't recognise
   (future schema additions, operator-added comments-as-fields) is
   preserved as a JSON value. Note: this is a JSON-value preservation,
   not a byte-for-byte one — `serde_json::to_string_pretty` rewrites
   whitespace, and `serde_json::Map` is alphabetical by default
   (BTreeMap, without the `preserve_order` feature), so operator
   formatting and key order do not survive. The *content* outside the
   two park keys is unchanged. The driver **never re-serialises its
   in-memory typed `Config`** to disk — that path would round-trip the
   CLI overrides (`--port`, `--baud`, `--server-port`, `--transport`)
   back into the file and is structurally avoided here.
5. **Atomic rename via `tempfile::NamedTempFile`.** The temp file is
   created in the **same directory** as the destination (required for
   `persist` to use POSIX `rename` rather than copy-and-delete),
   `sync_all`'d (fsync the file data) so a crash after rename can't
   surface a renamed-but-zero-length file, `persist`'d on success,
   then on unix the parent directory is fsync'd so the rename itself
   is durable. Same pattern as
   [`services/rp/src/persistence/document.rs::write_sidecar_sync`](../../services/rp/src/persistence/document.rs).
   On any error path the temp file auto-deletes via `Drop`, so a
   panic mid-write doesn't leave a `*.tmp` artifact behind.
6. **Blocking I/O on the blocking pool.** The whole read+parse+stage+
   fsync+rename sequence runs inside `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` so
   the async runtime isn't held up. Same pattern as `write_sidecar`.
7. **In-memory update follows disk.** The in-memory park target is
   updated only after the file write succeeds. If the file write
   fails, the in-memory park is unchanged and the caller sees an
   ASCOM error — there is no "partial success" state.

Blast-radius bound: even with a logic bug, the only keys the driver
ever writes are `mount.park_ra_ticks` and `mount.park_dec_ticks`. A
broken `SetPark` cannot corrupt `transport`, `server.auth`,
`server.tls`, or any other operator-managed field.

ASCOM has no notion of `SetPark` being non-durable, so `CanSetPark =
false` is the right answer when the driver has nowhere to persist to —
returning `true` and silently losing the park across restarts would
violate the capability contract. The binary always resolves a real
config path now, so it always *does* have somewhere to persist; the
`false` answer survives only as the library default for
`MountDevice::new`, exercised by unit tests.

### PulseGuide lifecycle

A guide pulse is a temporary rate shift on the targeted axis,
implemented from the existing `:K` / `:G` / `:I` / `:J` tracking
primitives — no `:P` (that's the ST4 hardware-jack rate setter, not a
host-driven pulse command). This matches what `indi-eqmod`'s
`GuideNorth` / `GuideSouth` / `GuideEast` / `GuideWest` do.

```
PulseGuide(direction, duration)
   │
   ├─ validate: !AtPark, !disconnected, !slew_in_progress,
   │            !pulse_guiding.<targeted_axis>; duration = 0 → return Ok
   ├─ resolve direction → (axis, ccw, rate_factor):
   │     East  → (RA,  ccw=false, 1 - guide_rate_ra_fraction)
   │     West  → (RA,  ccw=false, 1 + guide_rate_ra_fraction)
   │     North → (Dec, ccw=false, guide_rate_dec_fraction)
   │     South → (Dec, ccw=true,  guide_rate_dec_fraction)
   ├─ compute shifted period:
   │     period = round(sidereal_step_period(tmr_freq, cpr_ra) / rate_factor)
   ├─ capture tracking_was_on = state.tracking_requested (RA pulses only)
   ├─ set pulse_guiding.<axis> = true                ; synchronous, pre-spawn
   │
   ├─ on the wire (in PulseGuide call thread):
   │     :K<axis>           stop and wait for running flag clear
   │     :G<axis> TRACKING + ccw
   │     :I<axis> period
   │     :J<axis>
   │
   ├─ spawn watcher task:
   │     tokio::sleep(duration)
   │     if !pulse_guiding.<axis>      → bail (external cancellation)
   │     if !transport.is_available()  → clear flag, bail
   │     if state.at_park || slew_in_progress → clear flag, bail
   │     ── otherwise restore prior state:
   │     RA  pulse: :K1 + stop-and-wait, then
   │                if tracking_was_on:
   │                    :G1 TRACKING (ccw=false)
   │                    :I1 sidereal_period
   │                    :J1
   │     Dec pulse: :K2 + stop-and-wait (Dec is normally idle; no restore)
   │     clear pulse_guiding.<axis>
   │
   └─ return immediately to the Alpaca caller
```

`IsPulseGuiding` returns `pulse_guiding.ra || pulse_guiding.dec` —
perpendicular pulses (one RA + one Dec) run concurrently; a same-axis
re-pulse while one is in flight is rejected with `INVALID_OPERATION`.

**Cross-cutting cancellation rule.** Any operation that mutates a given
axis — `set_tracking`, `slew_to_coordinates_async`, `park`,
`abort_slew`, `sync_to_coordinates`, `set_connected(false)` — clears
the corresponding `pulse_guiding.<axis>` flag *before* issuing its own
wire commands. The watcher's post-sleep restore step checks the flag
and bails out if cleared, so the new operation owns the axis without
racing the watcher. Without this, `set_tracking(false)` during an East
pulse would be silently undone when the watcher re-issued sidereal
tracking on restore.

**Dec sign convention.** `+Dec` always maps to `ccw=false`, regardless
of side-of-pier. The driver does not invert Dec direction after a
meridian flip — the existing slew/sync pipeline doesn't either; it
assumes a stable encoder-to-celestial-Dec mapping and requires the
user to `SyncToCoordinates` after a manual flip to recalibrate. A
PulseGuide call after a flip with no re-sync will guide in the wrong
celestial direction; this is consistent with the rest of the driver
and is the autoguider's responsibility to detect (via guide
calibration).

**Step-period unit reuse.** `sidereal_step_period(tmr_freq, cpr_ra)`
is also used for the Dec rate computation. The protocol's step-period
units are timer-counter ticks per motor step on both axes, and
`cpr_ra` ≈ `cpr_dec` on the GTi, so reusing the helper avoids a near-
duplicate `sidereal_step_period_dec`. INDI takes the same shortcut.

**Guide-rate fraction validation.** Internal storage is two fractions
in `(0.0, 1.0)` open interval (RA and Dec independently). The
exclusive upper bound matters: `fraction = 1.0` makes East's
`rate_factor = 0`, which divides by zero in the period formula. INDI
clamps at 0.9 for the same reason. ASCOM clients see deg/sec through
`GuideRateRightAscension` / `GuideRateDeclination`; the setter
validates `(0, SIDEREAL_DEG_PER_SEC)` and converts to fraction.

### Side-of-pier

`SideOfPier` is derived from the **Dec-axis encoder position**, the
Dec-axis CPR, and the site latitude — the canonical GEM convention used
by INDI eqmod (`eqmodbase.cpp::EncodersToRADec`):

- In **northern hemisphere** (`SiteLatitude ≥ 0`): a Dec encoder
  magnitude within ±90° (= `±cpr_dec/4` ticks) of home means the mount
  reached the target without a meridian flip — counterweight east, OTA
  west of pier → `PierSide::West`. A Dec encoder magnitude past 90° in
  either direction means the Dec axis has rotated through one of the
  celestial poles — counterweight west, OTA east of pier →
  `PierSide::East`. The boundary at exactly ±90° is included in `West`
  (the mount can sit at either celestial pole via normal pointing).
- In **southern hemisphere** (`SiteLatitude < 0`): the convention
  inverts.

Earlier revisions split on the RA mechanical hour angle at `HA = 0`.
The Dec-encoder split returns the same value as the HA split for any
pointing state reachable inside the safety envelope — which is why
ConformU's `SideofPier` test passed against both — but the two diverge
when the mount is manually positioned past the pole (e.g. a power-cycle
with the OTA pointing through-the-pole and the encoder reset placing
the initial position on the wrong side). The Dec-encoder convention
reports the right answer for that state; the HA-split convention
inherits the RA encoder's sign and misreports it. INDI's convention is
the canonical one.

`DestinationSideOfPier(targetRA, targetDec)` predicts the pointing
state without issuing wire traffic. It runs the same flip-policy
decision tree `SlewToCoordinatesAsync` uses to pick the target side
(see [§Meridian flip](#meridian-flip)), maps the target to encoder
ticks for the chosen side, and validates against the corresponding
per-side safety envelope with the same `INVALID_VALUE` rejection a
slew would issue. With `flip_policy.enabled = false` the decision
collapses to "current side", so for any target inside the (pre-flip)
safety envelope `DestinationSideOfPier` returns `West` in the
Northern Hemisphere (`East` in the Southern) — the driver does not
plan flips. With `flip_policy.enabled = true` the prediction can
return the opposite side when the target requires a flip to reach.

### Meridian flip

A meridian flip transitions the German Equatorial Mount from "normal
pointing" (`PierSide::West`: counterweight east, OTA west of pier) to
"flipped pointing" (`PierSide::East`: counterweight west, OTA east of
pier, Dec axis rotated past the celestial pole) while keeping the OTA
on the same celestial target. On a flip-capable mount the move is a
single slew with the RA encoder routed through a half of the encoder
range that keeps the counterweight clear of the pier.

The GTi's mechanical envelope — hardware-confirmed 2026-05-13 — is
`mech_HA ∈ [−6.99 h, +6.99 h]` for the pre-flip half. The post-flip
half is mechanically symmetric across the encoder wrap at `±12 h`: the
counterweight rises off the local horizon on the mirror side of the
pier. The routing detail and the geometric symmetry argument live in
[`docs/plans/star-adventurer-gti-meridian-flip.md`](../plans/star-adventurer-gti-meridian-flip.md)
§2.0; this section specifies the behavioural contract the driver
implements on top of it.

`MountConfig::flip_policy` controls whether and when the driver plans
a flip. Four fields:

- **`enabled: bool`** (default `false`) — master switch. With
  `enabled = false`: `CanSetPierSide = false`, `SetSideOfPier` returns
  `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`, `DestinationSideOfPier` always returns the
  current pier side (driver never plans a flip), and
  `SlewToCoordinatesAsync` uses the pre-flip (`pierWest` in the
  Northern Hemisphere) coordinate pipeline only — behaviour identical
  to Phase 5. With `enabled = true`: the capability flag flips on
  and the slew planner picks the target pier side per the policy
  below.
- **`flip_range_hours: f64`** (default `0.5`) — half-width of the
  target-HA window around the meridian where the flipped state is
  mechanically reachable. Targets with `|target_HA| > flip_range_hours`
  are unflippable (the post-flip `mech_HA` would land outside the
  symmetric mirror band); the slew planner uses normal pointing only
  and `DestinationSideOfPier` returns the current side. Valid range
  `(0, 0.95]`. The upper bound matches the headroom past
  counterweight-horizontal on the pre-flip side (Phase 1.1 hardware
  verification); a larger value would push the post-flip `mech_HA`
  into the unverified mirror of the CW exclusion zone.
- **`auto_flip_during_tracking: bool`** (default `false`) — when
  `true` (and `enabled` is `true`), the driver initiates a meridian
  flip on its own once continuous tracking carries the target past
  the configured meridian offset, instead of waiting for the host to
  call `SetSideOfPier`. See
  [§Auto-flip during tracking](#auto-flip-during-tracking).
- **`auto_flip_at_meridian_offset_hours: f64`** (default `0.0`) —
  target HA at which the auto-flip fires. Only consulted when
  `auto_flip_during_tracking = true`. Must be finite and within
  `[−flip_range_hours, +flip_range_hours]` (validated at config
  load — a cross-field rule on the `flip_policy` block). See
  [§Auto-flip during tracking](#auto-flip-during-tracking).

#### Safety envelope (CW exclusion zone)

Mechanical safety on the GTi is dominated by one specific hazard:
**the counterweights must not rise more than 0.95 h (≈ 14°) above
horizontal at any point in a slew path.** As the dec axis rotates
around the polar axis, the CW shaft crosses horizontal at
`mech_HA = +0.95`, peaks at `mech_HA = +6`, and crosses horizontal
again at `mech_HA = +11.05`. The arc where the CW is more than
0.95 h above horizontal — and where in turn the OTA on the opposite
end of the dec axis can contact the tripod or pier — is the
contiguous range `(+0.95, +11.05)`. The constraint is **one-sided**:
the negative-mech_HA half puts the CW into the floor beneath the
pier rather than above the mount head, so no mirror zone applies.

The driver enforces this as a single interval on the **chosen-side
encoder mech_HA**, in `MountConfig::cw_exclusion_zone` — an active
`{ min_hours, max_hours }` interval (defaults `0.95` and `11.05` — the
wide zone derived from the 0.95 h rule and hardware-verified at lat
32.7°N), or `null` to disable:

- A slew or sync's *target* mech_HA inside the interval is rejected
  with `INVALID_VALUE` before any motion (the destination check).
- A slew's *path* — the linear mech_HA sweep from current encoder to
  target encoder — is also checked. Crossings happen even when both
  endpoints sit outside the zone (e.g. cur `+0.5 h` → tgt `+11.5 h`
  sweeps through the entire zone interior). Path violations on a
  non-flip slew return `INVALID_OPERATION` ([`check_non_flip_ra_path`]).
  Flip slews have one degree of freedom (canonical short or long way
  around): [`flip_slew_ra_delta`] tries both and returns
  `INVALID_OPERATION` only when both directions cross the zone.
- For natural-side targets, `target_mech_HA = celestial_HA` (folded
  signed into `[−12, +12)`).
- For flipped-side targets, `target_mech_HA = celestial_HA + 12 h`
  (folded).
- Setting `cw_exclusion_zone` to `null` (disabled) turns off both the
  destination and path checks — used by BDD scenarios that pass
  hardcoded celestial coords whose computed mech_HA depends on
  wallclock LST.

Historical note: a narrower `(+6.95, +11.05)` zone was used before
2026-05-17. That captured only the *outer* portion of the exclusion
arc (CW descending past the pier from above), missing the inner
ascent through which the OTA contacted the tripod during a
`SetSideOfPier` from Park 3 in San Diego. The wider zone closes
that gap; the path-aware long-way-also-cross check ensures the
helper can't silently redirect a slew through the newly-covered
inner half just because the short way was blocked.

`Park` writes the target encoder ticks directly without consulting
the exclusion-zone check — also mirroring EQMOD's privileged-park
pattern. The operator's `park_ra_ticks` / `park_dec_ticks` are
assumed to have been validated against the zone at the time of
configuration.

#### Altitude floor

The second, independent gate on slew / sync targets is a **minimum
apparent-altitude floor** (`min_altitude_degrees`, default `0.0` — the
geometric horizon). The driver computes the target's local altitude
from its hour angle, declination, and the site latitude:

```
sin(alt) = sin(lat) · sin(dec) + cos(lat) · cos(dec) · cos(HA)
```

and rejects the operation with `INVALID_VALUE` (naming the computed
altitude and the configured floor) when `alt < min_altitude_degrees`.
A target *at* the floor is accepted. Altitude is a celestial property
of the target — the check uses the celestial `HA = LST − RA`, so it is
the same for both pier sides of a flip-planned slew.

This replaced the earlier rectangular celestial-Dec envelope
(`dec_limits`, removed 2026-07-01; `MountConfig`'s `deny_unknown_fields`
(#484) means a config file still carrying `dec_limits` now fails to load
with the field named, rather than being silently ignored). The rectangle
was the
wrong shape for what operators mean by "don't slew there": the local
horizon is a tilted great circle on the celestial sphere, so a
rectangle is simultaneously too loose (accepts below-horizon targets at
mid Dec, e.g. `(HA = −3 h, dec = −40°)` at LAT 45°N → alt `−4°`) and
too tight when narrowed (rejects legitimate above-horizon targets like
`(HA = −3 h, dec = −30°)` → alt `+4.5°`). The altitude floor follows
the horizon circle exactly.

The floor accepts values in `[-90, +90]`:

- `0.0` (default) — geometric horizon. Refraction-corrected pointing
  (apparent horizon ≈ geometric `−0.5°`) is available by setting
  `-0.5`.
- `5.0` / `10.0` — operator buffer for refraction, horizon light
  pollution, or local obstructions.
- Negative values allow below-horizon pointing (dust-cap operations,
  closed-roof flats). The driver logs `info!` at startup when the floor
  is negative so the relaxed state is discoverable in support
  transcripts. `-90` never rejects anything (the check is
  effectively disabled — the BDD suite ships this in its default test
  config because scenario targets are wallclock-LST-dependent).

Like the CW exclusion zone, the floor gates `SlewToCoordinatesAsync` /
`SlewToTargetAsync`, `SyncToCoordinates` / `SyncToTarget`, and the
per-side validation inside `DestinationSideOfPier`. `Park` is exempt —
park targets are mechanically-defined encoder ticks the operator chose
explicitly via `SetPark` (the same privileged-park pattern as the
exclusion-zone check). The out-of-range celestial gate
(`validate_coordinates`, RA `[0, 24)` / Dec `[-90, +90]`) remains a
separate, earlier check.

#### Tracking-time safety guard

The safety envelope above is enforced at *slew* time. But `Tracking =
true` issues `:G` + `:I` + `:J` on the RA axis and from that point the
firmware advances the encoder autonomously — the driver sends no
further wire commands and the slew-time path checks never re-run. A
multi-hour session that begins at a safe negative `mech_HA` drifts up
across the zone entry (`mech_HA = +0.95` by default) with no operator
action: the same physical failure mode as a zone-crossing slew, reached
via tracking drift instead of a slew command (issue #259).

A per-connection background guard closes that gap. While `Tracking =
true` it watches the live encoder `mech_HA` — read from the snapshot
the background poll loop already refreshes, at `polling_interval`, so
the guard adds no extra wire traffic. When `mech_HA` enters the band
`(min_hours − margin, max_hours + margin)` — the active
`cw_exclusion_zone` widened by `tracking_guard_margin_hours` on each
edge — the guard:

1. issues `:K1` to stop the RA axis,
2. clears the in-memory `Tracking` flag to match the wire, and
3. emits a `warn!` explaining why.

It does **not** pick a pier side or flip. Post-guard state is
`Tracking = false`, `Slewing = false`, the encoder wherever it was when
the guard fired (no automatic park). The operator — or higher-level
automation — decides what to do next: flip via `SetSideOfPier`, slew
elsewhere, or park.

`tracking_guard_margin_hours` (default `0.05` h ≈ 45 s of sidereal
drift) lets cautious operators stop *before* the zone entry rather than
at it; `0.0` stops exactly at the zone's `min_hours`. A non-finite,
negative, or over-cap (> 1.0 h) margin is rejected at config load by the
`TrackingGuardMarginHours` newtype's deserialize; the guard additionally
treats a non-finite or negative value as `0.0` as defense-in-depth. The
guard is **independent of `flip_policy.enabled`**: it is the safety floor
that keeps an unattended autoguided session from contacting hardware
whether or not meridian-flip support is configured. It is disabled only
when `cw_exclusion_zone` is `null` (`Disabled`). Because
`slew_to_coordinates_async` clears `Tracking` for a slew's duration, the
guard is naturally dormant during slews and resumes once the
completion watcher re-engages tracking on the new pose.

Driver-planned auto-flip during tracking — flipping ahead of the zone
instead of just stopping — is available as an opt-in on top of this
guard; see [§Auto-flip during tracking](#auto-flip-during-tracking).
The guard stays as the belt-and-suspenders fallback for when an
auto-flip attempt fails (and whenever auto-flip is disabled, which is
the shipped default).

#### Auto-flip during tracking

With `flip_policy.enabled = true` **and**
`flip_policy.auto_flip_during_tracking = true`, the same
per-connection watcher that runs the tracking-time safety guard also
initiates a driver-planned meridian flip on its own. While `Tracking =
true` on the natural (pre-flip) pier side, the watcher compares the
live encoder `mech_HA` — which equals the tracked target's celestial
HA on that side — against
`flip_policy.auto_flip_at_meridian_offset_hours`. Once `mech_HA`
reaches the offset, the watcher issues the same through-wrap flip slew
an explicit `SetSideOfPier(opposite)` would: tracking stops for the
slew's duration, both axes route through their safe segments (see
[§Through-wrap slew routing](#through-wrap-slew-routing)), and the
slew-completion watcher re-engages tracking on the new pier side (the
standard "if Tracking was on" branch of the slew lifecycle).

Semantics and interactions:

- **One attempt per meridian crossing.** A failed flip attempt (no
  safe RA path, a wire error, a concurrent slew) logs a `warn!` and
  is not retried; the stop-only safety guard remains the fallback and
  stops the mount at the guarded band if tracking keeps drifting. The
  attempt latch re-arms once `mech_HA` drops below the offset again —
  a successful flip does that naturally (the post-flip encoder lands
  near `offset − 12 h`), as does any slew back east of the offset.
- **The guard has precedence.** When a tick finds `mech_HA` already
  inside the guarded band (`zone ± margin`), the guard stops the
  mount rather than attempting a flip — reaching the band means the
  flip window has effectively been missed.
- **Natural side only.** Only the natural → flipped direction is
  automated. On the post-flip side, tracking drifts *away* from the
  CW exclusion zone (`mech_HA` rising from ≈ `offset − 12`), so there
  is no safety motivation to auto-flip back; flipping back is the
  next slew's (or the operator's) decision, per the
  [pier-side decision tree](#pier-side-decision-tree).
- **Off by default.** Hosts like NINA / SGP / `rp` own flip timing
  themselves via `SetSideOfPier`, and an unexpected mid-exposure
  auto-flip breaks astrophotography frames and autoguiding. Operators
  running fully unattended sessions without a flip-aware host opt in.
  With `flip_policy.enabled = false`, `auto_flip_during_tracking` is
  inert (the master switch disables every flip code path). In
  particular, `rp`'s mount motion gate (rp.md § Mount Motion Gate)
  presumes rp is the sole source of non-guiding mount motion — keep
  auto-flip disabled on rp-orchestrated rigs.
- **Offset semantics.** `0.0` (the default) flips exactly at meridian
  crossing. A small positive value (e.g. `+0.3`) waits until the
  target is that far past the meridian — the common astrophotography
  preference, letting the in-progress sub finish (matches NINA's
  "delay meridian flip by N minutes" semantics). Must be finite and
  within `[−flip_range_hours, +flip_range_hours]`, validated at
  config load; outside that window the flipped state isn't reachable
  and the flip slew would be refused anyway.
- **Hosts observe the flip normally.** The flip is visible as
  `Slewing = true` plus the subsequent `SideOfPier` change, exactly
  like an explicit `SetSideOfPier` — guiding / imaging restart
  coordination stays with the host.

#### Pier-side decision tree

`DestinationSideOfPier(ra, dec)` and `SlewToCoordinatesAsync(ra,
dec)` share the same selector:

1. If `flip_policy.enabled = false`, return the current `SideOfPier`.
2. Compute `target_HA = LST − ra` (signed, folded to `[−12, +12)`).
3. If the *current* side can reach the target without entering the
   CW exclusion zone, stay on the current side (no unnecessary flip):
   - **Pre-flip side** (`pierWest` in the Northern Hemisphere,
     `pierEast` in the Southern): "covers" means `target_HA ∉
     binding_zone`. This is wider than the legacy
     `[ra_min_hours, ra_max_hours]` window — the whole sky except
     the CW exclusion zone.
   - **Post-flip side**: "covers" means `|target_HA| ≤
     flip_range_hours`. This is an *operational* preference (after
     a flip, the driver expects to flip back to natural side soon),
     not a hard mechanical constraint. The post-flip side could
     mechanically be tracked far past `±flip_range_hours`, but the
     decision tree treats anything outside as "should flip back".
4. Otherwise return the *opposite* side.

The driver does not pre-emptively flip; it only flips when the
target can't be reached from the current side (per rule 3) or when
`SetSideOfPier` forces it. The post-flip operational window
(`flip_range_hours`) is small — `0.5 h` by default — so the
practical pattern is: pre-flip side covers most of the sky; an
explicit or implicit flip rotates the mount through the meridian to
the post-flip side for tracking a target past meridian crossing;
the next slew that targets HA outside the flip window auto-flips
back to the pre-flip side.

Park 1 / Park 5 anti-meridian poses are reachable via
`SlewToCoordinatesAsync` because they live at `target_HA = ±12 h`
on the natural / flipped pier respectively, and their corresponding
`mech_HA` (folded `−12` for Park 1 on pierWest, `0` for Park 5 on
pierEast) is outside the CW exclusion zone.

#### `SetSideOfPier(side)`

`SetSideOfPier(side)` is the explicit flip trigger:

- `side == current_side`: no-op success.
- `side != current_side`: triggers a through-wrap flip slew that
  keeps the OTA on the current target while landing on the requested
  pier side.
- `PierSide::Unknown`: rejected with `INVALID_VALUE`.

`SetSideOfPier` returns `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` when `flip_policy.enabled
= false`, and follows the standard `NOT_CONNECTED` /
`INVALID_WHILE_PARKED` / `INVALID_OPERATION` (already-slewing) gate.
After a successful flip the next encoder snapshot's `SideOfPier` reads
the new value (the Dec encoder has moved past the pole);
`TargetRightAscension` / `TargetDeclination` remain unchanged.

#### Through-wrap slew routing

When the slew planner decides to flip (either via `SetSideOfPier` or
because the decision tree picked the opposite side), both axes are
routed through specific safe segments of their encoder ranges. The
RA axis stays in the counterweight-below-horizon half; the Dec axis
crosses the *visible* celestial pole rather than the below-horizon
one.

**RA axis:** the CW exclusion zone at
`mech_HA ∈ (+0.95, +11.05)` is one-sided and hemisphere-independent;
every other arc of the polar-axis circle is safe. The routing rule is
therefore stated directly in terms of the zone rather than as a sign
proxy:

- Compute the canonical short delta's mech_HA sweep
  (`[current_mech_HA, current_mech_HA + canonical_delta_ha]`).
- If that sweep stays outside `(zone_min, zone_max)` (modulo 24 h —
  the zone copy at `k ∈ {-1, 0, +1}` is checked, enough to cover any
  `|canonical_delta_ha| ≤ 12 h` path), use the canonical direction.
- Otherwise try the long way (`canonical ± cpr_ra`), which lands at
  the same modular destination via the opposite arc.
- If the long way *also* crosses the zone, there is no safe RA path
  between current and target and the slew is refused with
  `INVALID_OPERATION`. (Hardware-revealed 2026-05-17: a
  `SetSideOfPier` from Park 3 took the long way under the narrower
  `(+6.95, +11.05)` zone, which permitted the path; under the wider
  `(+0.95, +11.05)` zone both directions cross and the helper now
  rejects the slew.)

This handles the forward-flip case (pre-flip near meridian → post-flip
wrap, canonical CCW already in the safe negative half), the flip-back
case (post-flip wrap on either side of the `±12` boundary → pre-flip
near meridian, canonical short path stays in the safe arc), and the
edge case the prior sign-blind heuristic mis-fired on:
**hardware validation 2026-05-16, Park 4 N → Park 5 N flip-back.**
Current `mech_HA ≈ −11.97` (post-flip pierEast just east of the
saddle-east wrap), target `mech_HA ≈ +11.99` (pre-flip pierWest just
west of the same wrap). Canonical short delta is a ~4 k-tick CCW
nudge that physically just crosses the `−12 ↔ +12` wrap; the old
`|current| > cpr_ra/4 ⇒ "safe is positive"` rule misread that as
"in the post-flip half, force positive" and issued a `+cpr_ra − 4 k`
≈ +3.625 M-tick CW full revolution that swept mech_HA through
`(+6.95, +11.05)` and slammed the CW shaft into the pier. The
path-aware check preserves the safe canonical step.

Empty zone (`zone_min ≥ zone_max`) disables the routing — the
canonical short delta is always used. BDD tests rely on this to keep
small-distance scenarios from accidentally triggering the long way
when the wall-clock LST puts a synthetic target inside the default
zone.

**Dec axis:** routed through the visible celestial pole, NOT the
below-horizon pole. For a polar-aligned mount, only one of the two
celestial poles is above the local horizon — NCP at altitude `+lat`
for Northern observers, SCP at altitude `+|lat|` for Southern. The
encoder positions are `+cpr_dec/4` (NCP) and `−cpr_dec/4` (SCP). The
Dec axis must traverse the visible pole during a flip slew; routing
through the below-horizon pole drives the OTA into the ground
(altitude `−|lat|` at the dip).

The rule, expressed by encoder side:

- **Northern** observer (safe pole `+cpr_dec/4`):
  - `current_dec_encoder` in the pre-flip half (`|enc| ≤ cpr_dec/4`):
    force the Dec slew CW (positive delta). The path crosses
    `+cpr_dec/4` from below.
  - `current_dec_encoder` in the post-flip half (`|enc| > cpr_dec/4`):
    force CCW (negative delta). The path descends back through
    `+cpr_dec/4`.
- **Southern** observer: inverted. Safe pole is `−cpr_dec/4` (SCP).

The canonical fold's boundary case at exactly `±cpr_dec/2` (e.g.
flipping from `dec_encoder = 0` to a celestial target of `dec = 0`
where the post-flip target is `+180° ≡ −180°`) lands on the negative
direction by default; for a Northern observer that routes through
SCP and is the failure mode the first real-hardware validation
exposed. The fix forces the long way around (`delta − cpr` or
`delta + cpr`) so the path always crosses the *safe* pole.

The slew lifecycle (see [§Slew lifecycle](#slew-lifecycle)) is
otherwise unchanged: the same `:K → :G → :I → :H → :M → :J`
wire sequence per axis, the same EQMOD pickup loop, the same settle
delay. The flip slew differs from a normal slew only in which
encoder target the planner computes and which CCW bit `:G` issues
per axis (forced to the safe-direction sign on flip slews, so the
routing goes "under" the polar axis on RA and through the visible
pole on Dec rather than taking the shortest-encoder path).

#### Hardware validation

`flip_policy.enabled` defaults to `false` until the through-wrap
flip-back path is hardware-verified end-to-end on a GTi.

**2026-05-16, lat 32.7°N (San Diego).** The AP Park 1–5 sequence ran
end-to-end:

1. `Park 3 → Park 2`: small Dec slew (−90° to celestial equator).
2. `Park 2 → staging (HA = 0, Dec = −57.3°)`: pre-flip pierWest small
   slew; no routing change.
3. `SetSideOfPier(East) → Park 4 N`: through-wrap flip slew — RA
   −180° (saddle west → east) + Dec +294° CW (through wrap, past
   NCP, ending past-pole at `dec_encoder ≈ −122.78°`).
4. `Slew to (LST + 12 h, Dec = +57.3°) → Park 5 N`: flip-back over
   the saddle-east wrap. Wire issued was RA **−3,631 ticks CCW**
   (canonical short path, ~0.024° of polar-axis rotation) + Dec
   −180° CCW via NCP. The earlier sign-blind heuristic issued a
   +3.625 M-tick CW full revolution instead and the operator
   powered the mount off mid-sweep — see §"Through-wrap slew
   routing" above for the path-aware fix.
5. `Park → Park 3 N`: clean unwind.

All five poses confirmed visually. The dec axis's analogous routing
helper (`flip_slew_dec_delta`) was not exercised on its
sign-blind edge case in this session (current dec was on the
`+cpr_dec/2` side of the wrap where the old heuristic happens to be
correct); a follow-up issue tracks porting the path-aware fix to that
function.

## Configuration

JSON, deserialised with `serde` + `humantime-serde` for `Duration`
fields. The transport block is a tagged enum: `usb` or `udp`.

The mount block is **validated at deserialize** (parse-don't-validate):
the range-carrying fields are newtypes whose `serde` `try_from` rejects an
out-of-range value during `load_config`, with the offending field named,
so a bad config fails at startup rather than mid-session. `flip_range_hours`
must be `(0, 0.95]`; `tracking_guard_margin_hours` `[0, 1.0]`; an active
`cw_exclusion_zone` must satisfy `-12 ≤ min_hours < max_hours ≤ 12`;
`min_altitude_degrees` must be finite in `[-90, 90]`;
`auto_flip_at_meridian_offset_hours` must be finite and within
`±flip_range_hours` (a cross-field rule, checked on the `flip_policy`
block). (This
replaced the former runtime `MountConfig::validate` / `FlipPolicy::validate`
— see [ADR-006](../decisions/006-typed-physical-quantities-for-mount-pointing.md).)
Every genuinely-operator-config struct (`Config`, `UsbConfig`, `UdpConfig`,
`ServerConfig`, `MountConfig`, `FlipPolicy`, and the `cw_exclusion_zone` wire
shape) additionally rejects unknown keys at deserialize
(`deny_unknown_fields`), so a typo or a key removed by a schema change fails
loudly at load instead of being silently ignored.

Notes:

- `bind_address` is **mandatory** for UDP (must be a 192.168.4.0/24 host
  IP when the mount is in AP mode). Without it, the kernel may select a
  source IP that the mount cannot reach, and packets are silently
  dropped.
- `polling_interval` controls the rate at which the background loop reads
  `:f` (axis status) and `:j` (axis position). 200 ms is a reasonable
  default; `rp` polls `Slewing` no faster than 100 ms so this gives the
  driver headroom.
- `settle_after_slew` is applied *after* both axes report stopped, before
  `Slewing` clears. Mirrors `rp`'s `mount.settle_after_slew` config.
- `site_latitude_deg` is in WGS84 degrees, `+N`. `site_longitude_deg` is
  WGS84 degrees, `+E`. (ASCOM convention.)
- `unique_id` is the ASCOM `UniqueID`. It is **generated, not
  hand-authored** — leave it empty (or omit it) and the driver mints a
  spec-compliant UUIDv4 on first run, persisting it to this file and
  never overwriting it. The example value above is illustrative; yours
  will differ. See [§Device identity (UniqueID)](#device-identity-uniqueid).
- `tracking_rate` accepts `"sidereal"` only in MVP. Field is reserved
  for future expansion.
- `cw_exclusion_zone` defines the CW exclusion interval in encoder
  `mech_HA` (signed hours folded `[−12, +12)`) as either an active
  `{ "min_hours": .., "max_hours": .. }` object or `null` (disabled).
  Slews / syncs whose chosen-side `mech_HA` falls inside the interval
  are rejected with `INVALID_VALUE`; flip slews and non-flip slews
  additionally check that their swept path doesn't cross the zone
  (`INVALID_OPERATION` if so — see
  [§Safety envelope](#safety-envelope-cw-exclusion-zone)).
  Default `{ "min_hours": 0.95, "max_hours": 11.05 }` for the GTi — the
  one-sided arc where the CW shaft rises more than 0.95 h above
  horizontal, peaking at `mech_HA = +6 h`. The negative-mech_HA side is
  *not* a CW exclusion zone (CW points into the ground beneath the pier,
  not above the mount head). An active zone must satisfy
  `-12 ≤ min_hours < max_hours ≤ 12`; use `null` to disable (tests, or
  mounts whose geometry differs).
- `tracking_guard_margin_hours` extends CW exclusion-zone enforcement
  to *tracking* time: a background guard stops the mount (`:K1`) once
  the live encoder `mech_HA` drifts into the active zone widened by
  `margin` on each edge, while `Tracking = true`. Defaults `0.05` h
  (≈ 45 s of sidereal drift); `0.0` stops exactly at the zone entry;
  valid range `[0, 1.0]`. Independent of `flip_policy.enabled`. See
  [§Tracking-time safety guard](#tracking-time-safety-guard).
- `min_altitude_degrees` rejects slew / sync targets whose computed
  apparent altitude (from HA + Dec + `site_latitude_deg`) is below the
  floor. Default `0.0` (geometric horizon); must be finite in
  `[-90, 90]`. Negative values permit below-horizon pointing and are
  logged `info!` at startup; `-90` effectively disables the check. See
  [§Altitude floor](#altitude-floor). (Replaced the rectangular
  `dec_limits` envelope 2026-07-01; a stale `dec_limits` key is now
  rejected loudly at load, per `deny_unknown_fields` (#484).)
- `park_ra_ticks` / `park_dec_ticks` are written by `SetPark` and read
  on every connect; absent (or `null`) at first run, populated once
  `SetPark` is called. Operators may set them by hand to pin a known
  mechanical pose. See [§Park persistence](#park-persistence) for the
  rules around when the driver writes to this file. When absent, the
  park target falls back to the `preferred_ap_park` pose ticks **when
  the coordinate frame is anchored** (named `unpark_from_ap_position`,
  or a sync this connection); with an unanchored frame and no raw
  override there is no park target and `Park()` stops in place. See
  [§Park lifecycle](#park-lifecycle).
- `flip_policy.enabled` defaults `false`. Set to `true` only after
  the first real-hardware meridian flip has been verified on the
  specific mount (see [§Hardware validation](#hardware-validation)).
  While `false`, `CanSetPierSide` reports `false` and the driver
  ignores flip routing entirely.
- `flip_policy.flip_range_hours` defaults `0.5`. Half-width of the
  target-HA window around the meridian where the flipped state is
  reachable. Valid range `(0, 0.95]`; the upper bound is the verified
  safe headroom past counterweight-horizontal on the pre-flip side.
  See [§Meridian flip](#meridian-flip).
- `flip_policy.auto_flip_during_tracking` defaults `false`. When
  `true` (and `flip_policy.enabled` is `true`), the tracking watcher
  initiates a meridian flip on its own once tracking carries the
  target past `auto_flip_at_meridian_offset_hours`, re-engaging
  tracking on the new pier side afterwards. The stop-only tracking
  guard remains the fallback when a flip attempt fails. See
  [§Auto-flip during tracking](#auto-flip-during-tracking).
- `flip_policy.auto_flip_at_meridian_offset_hours` defaults `0.0`
  (flip exactly at meridian crossing; positive values delay the flip
  past the meridian). Must be finite and within `±flip_range_hours` —
  validated at load as a cross-field rule on the `flip_policy` block.
- `unpark_from_ap_position` is **required** (no default in the schema
  sense, but the ship default is `"ap_park_0"` — the field is the
  operator's declared physical position assumption, and "current
  position" is the only honest value when nothing was declared).
  One of `"ap_park_0"` through `"ap_park_5"`. A named park
  (`ap_park_1..ap_park_5`) tells the driver to seed the firmware
  encoder via `:E1` / `:E2` on every fresh-power-up connect to the
  codebase's convention for that pose — the operator's contract is to
  physically place the OTA at that park before powering on. This
  anchors the coordinate frame, which is what allows `Park()` to slew
  (see [§Park lifecycle](#park-lifecycle)); operators with a
  repeatable setup should declare their pose (typically `ap_park_3`,
  Sky-Watcher's stock home). `ap_park_0` ("current position") means no
  encoder seeding: the driver trusts whatever the firmware reports and
  the operator plate-solves and `SyncToCoordinates` to ground-truth;
  until that sync the frame is unanchored and `Park()` stops in place
  instead of slewing. Runtime-modifiable via the
  `SetUnparkFromApPosition` custom Action (persisted to the same
  config file). See
  [§Unpark from AP position](#unpark-from-ap-position).
- `preferred_ap_park` (optional) — the AP park `Park()` slews to.
  Defaults to `"ap_park_3"` (the visible-celestial-pole pose, the
  Sky-Watcher stock power-up pose). Runtime-modifiable via the
  `SetPreferredApPark` custom Action. The legacy
  `park_ra_ticks` / `park_dec_ticks` keys remain as raw-encoder
  overrides for ops pinning a specific tick pair; when both are
  set, the explicit tick pair wins.

### Device identity (UniqueID)

ASCOM Alpaca requires every device's `UniqueID` to be **globally
unique** and to **never change**, but the protocol enforces neither —
uniqueness has to come from how the id is generated. The driver
therefore *generates* its `mount.unique_id` rather than shipping a
hardcoded literal (it previously shipped `"skywatcher-sa-gti-001"`,
which collided across every install).

On startup, before loading its configuration, the driver:

1. **Resolves a config-file path.** The `--config <path>` argument if
   given, else the platform default — the per-user config directory on
   Unix: `~/.config/rusty-photon/star-adventurer-gti.json` on Linux
   (XDG), `~/Library/Application Support/rusty-photon/star-adventurer-gti.json`
   on macOS (via `directories::ProjectDirs`) — and the machine-wide
   `%PROGRAMDATA%\rusty-photon\star-adventurer-gti.json` on Windows
   (`ProgramData` env var, `C:\ProgramData` fallback; a Windows service
   account's per-user profile is hidden, see ADR-015). A path is
   *always* resolvable, so identity and park persistence are never
   disabled for lack of a `--config` flag. This is the same path used
   for [§Park persistence](#park-persistence).
2. **Materializes the identity.** Via the shared
   `rusty_photon_config::resolve_and_init` bootstrap (which performs
   step 1's resolution and this step in one call), against the JSON
   pointer `/mount/unique_id`. If that pointer is absent, `null`,
   non-string, or an empty/whitespace string in the **file layer**, the
   driver mints a fresh UUIDv4, writes it into the file, and persists
   atomically (staged temp file → `fsync` → POSIX `rename` →
   parent-dir `fsync`, the same durability pattern as `SetPark`). The
   operation is **idempotent**: an id that already exists is never
   overwritten. On a *fresh install* (no file yet) the default scaffold
   written out is the serialized `Config::default()` with the minted id
   filled in, so the operator gets a complete, valid config file to
   edit.
3. **Loads the config** from that path (which now always exists) and
   applies the CLI overrides (`--transport`, `--port`, `--baud`,
   `--server-port`).

The materialize step operates **only on the on-disk file**, never on a
CLI-override-applied effective config, so a transient `--port` is never
baked into the persisted file. It touches only the `/mount/unique_id`
pointer; like `SetPark`, it reads the document as a `serde_json::Value`
and preserves every other field. The two writers never clobber each
other: the identity minting runs once at startup and `SetPark`'s
`write_mount_fields_to_config` runs at runtime, both read-modify-write
the same file as a `Value`, each mutate only their own keys
(`mount.unique_id` vs. `mount.park_ra_ticks` / `mount.park_dec_ticks`),
and each finishes with an atomic rename — so running materialize once at
startup and park-writes later is safe. The materialize-written scaffold
always contains a `mount` object, which is exactly the object
`write_mount_fields_to_config` and the connect-time field reader require.

Operators who need to pin a specific id (e.g. migrating an existing
profile in a client that keyed on the old value) can set `unique_id`
explicitly in the config file; the never-overwrite rule means a
hand-set id is preserved verbatim.

### Unpark from AP position

#### The position-assumption problem

The Sky-Watcher firmware resets its encoder counter to `(0, 0)` on
every power-up. Raw `0` is a coordinate-frame value, not a
physical-position value — which celestial point it corresponds to is
purely a function of where the operator physically placed the OTA
before powering on. The driver therefore *always* relies on an
operator-supplied position assumption to anchor the encoder math.

Every install declares that assumption explicitly via the required
`mount.unpark_from_ap_position` config field. The field carries one
of the named AP-park strings (`ap_park_0` through `ap_park_5`) and
has no default in the schema sense — the **ship default** is
`ap_park_0` ("I don't know where the OTA is; I will plate-solve and
sync"), because the field is the operator's assertion about the
physical world and no other value is true before the operator has
asserted anything. With `ap_park_0` the frame is unanchored and
`Park()` stops in place until a sync (see
[§Park lifecycle](#park-lifecycle)) — an unconfigured install can
never slew to a fabricated position. Operators with a repeatable
setup declare their power-up pose (typically `ap_park_3`,
Sky-Watcher's stock home — OTA at the pole, counterweight down):
a named pose anchors the coordinate frame from the first connect,
which keeps `Park()` a zero-distance no-op right after power-up.

#### The named poses

| `unpark_from_ap_position` | Semantics | AP description | Mech. pier | N hem (mech_HA, dec_enc) | S hem (mech_HA, dec_enc) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ap_park_0` (default) | **Current position.** No seeding — trust the firmware encoder as-is. Operator's responsibility is to plate-solve and `SyncToCoordinates` before any blind-pointing slew; until that sync the frame is unanchored and `Park()` stops in place. The honest default for an undeclared / unknown / variable physical setup. | — | — | — | — |
| `ap_park_1` | Fresh-power-up seed to this pose. | OTA on west, level, facing polar-side horizon. Celestial Dec = `±(90 − \|lat\|)`. | West | `(0 h, +(90 + \|lat\|)°)` (saddle west, dec past pole) | `(0 h, −(90 + \|lat\|)°)` (saddle west, dec past pole) |
| `ap_park_2` | Fresh-power-up seed to this pose. | OTA level facing east horizon, counterweight straight down. Hemisphere-independent celestial coords `(HA=−6, Dec=0)`. | — (CW down) | `(−6 h, 0°)` | `(−6 h, 0°)` |
| `ap_park_3` | Fresh-power-up seed to this pose. | OTA along polar axis at the visible celestial pole. Sky-Watcher's stock power-up pose — the typical choice for a repeatable setup. | — (CW along polar) | `(−6 h, +90°)` | `(−6 h, −90°)` |
| `ap_park_4` | Fresh-power-up seed to this pose. | OTA on east, level, facing anti-polar horizon. Celestial Dec = `∓(90 − \|lat\|)` (sign anti-hemisphere). | East | `(−12 h, −(90 + \|lat\|)°)` (saddle east, dec past pole) | `(−12 h, +(90 + \|lat\|)°)` (saddle east, dec past pole) |
| `ap_park_5` | Fresh-power-up seed to this pose. | OTA on east, level, facing polar-side horizon. Celestial Dec = `±(90 − \|lat\|)` (sign matches hemisphere). APCC-only in AP's own software. | East | `(−12 h, +(90 − \|lat\|)°)` (saddle east, dec normal) | `(−12 h, −(90 − \|lat\|)°)` (saddle east, dec normal) |

The named poses (1–5) follow the Astro-Physics
["Park Positions Defined"](https://astro-physics.info/tech_support/mounts/park-positions-defined.pdf)
document. Each AP pose describes a fixed mechanical pier side
(OTA-on-west-of-mount or OTA-on-east-of-mount) that's the same for
both hemispheres — but the driver's natural-vs-flipped pier convention
flips between hemispheres (N natural = pierWest, S natural = pierEast,
see `pre_flip_side` in `mount_device.rs`). So a pose like Park 1
(OTA-on-west-of-mount, mechanically) is on the **natural** side in the
Northern Hemisphere and on the **flipped** side in the Southern
Hemisphere — and its dec-encoder representation differs accordingly
(natural side gives `|dec_enc| ≤ 90°`; flipped side gives `|dec_enc| > 90°`
via the past-pole encoding).

The codebase's `mech_HA` is hemisphere-independent: the saddle east/west
position is determined by the encoder alone (`|mech_HA| ≤ 6 h` →
saddle west; `|mech_HA| > 6 h` → saddle east). The dec encoder *is*
hemisphere-dependent — at fixed `mech_HA`, the dec=0 reference points
at different celestial coords for N vs S, so the rotation needed to
reach the AP-described OTA pointing differs in magnitude.

The encoder values above were corrected via hardware verification at
lat 32.7°N on 2026-05-17. The earlier mapping (commit `2725a2f`) had
Park 1 and Park 5 swapped: it claimed Park 1 N was at
`(mech_HA=−12, dec_enc=+(90−|lat|)°)`, but that encoder pose
physically corresponds to AP Park 5 N (saddle east). The corrected
mapping places each AP pose at the encoder values that physically
match it.

Note on `SideOfPier` reporting: the codebase's `side_of_pier` uses
the ASCOM-spec convention (dec-past-pole indicates `pierEast`),
*not* the AP "OTA east of mount" geometric convention. AP Park 5 N
has saddle east physically but dec encoder normal (`+57°`), so the
codebase reports it as `pierWest` (pre-flip). AP Park 1 N has
saddle west but dec past pole (`+123°`), so the codebase reports
it as `pierEast` (post-flip). The encoder values match the AP
physical pose; only the `pierSide` label differs in convention.

#### Fresh-power-up auto-seed

`seed_after_connect` (renamed from `seed_home_pose_after_connect`)
fires on every connect when the configured
`unpark_from_ap_position` is one of `ap_park_1..ap_park_5` AND the
firmware encoder reading is within `FRESH_POWER_UP_TICK_TOLERANCE`
(currently 10 ticks, ~4″) of `(0, 0)`. When the configured value is
`ap_park_0` the seed is unconditionally skipped — the operator has
asserted that they will ground-truth the position themselves and the
driver does not touch the encoder.

The tolerance exists because the Sky-Watcher firmware does not always
read exactly `(0, 0)` after a power-cycle — empirically the
validation GTi reports `dec = −1` on connect, a single-tick
initialisation artifact (~0.4″) that obviously still represents the
just-powered-up state. Any genuine post-slew encoder is tens of
thousands of ticks away from zero, so a tight tolerance is enough
to absorb the firmware artifact without ever masking a real
mid-session position. Reconnecting mid-session after a slew is
therefore still safe — the seed skips on non-fresh encoders and
the live session state is preserved.

`seed_after_connect` emits two `info!()`-level log lines per connect
(when the configured pose is one of the named parks): a `pre-seed
encoder snapshot at connect` line with the firmware's pre-seed `(ra,
dec)` ticks, and a `seeded firmware encoder for unpark_from_ap_position`
line with the post-seed values. Operators expect the pre-seed pair
to read approximately `(0, 0)` on a fresh power-up; any larger
reading is a signal that either the previous slew's state survived
the connection state machine or the build is running against a mock
transport rather than the real wire.

Documented operator assumption: when `unpark_from_ap_position` is
set to one of `ap_park_1..ap_park_5`, the operator powers up the
mount **at** that configured pose and connects the driver before
any slew or sync.

#### Custom Actions for runtime control

Three driver-specific Actions (ASCOM `Action(name, parameters)`)
expose runtime control over the position assumption and the
preferred-park target. All three are advertised via `SupportedActions`.

| Action name | Parameters | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `SetUnparkFromApPosition` | `park` (`ap_park_0..ap_park_5`) | Validates the park name, writes the value into the running config file (atomic-rename pattern, mirrors `SetPark` persistence — see [§Park persistence](#park-persistence)), updates the in-memory config. The new value takes effect on the *next* fresh-power-up auto-seed; the current session's encoder is not touched. Refuses (`INVALID_OPERATION`) when no config path is available — at the library layer that means `MountDevice::new`; the binary always resolves one, so this refusal no longer fires in practice. |
| `SetPreferredApPark` | `park` (`ap_park_1..ap_park_5`) | Sets the AP-park target that `Park()` will slew to. Persisted to config alongside the same file-write pattern. `ap_park_0` is not a valid value here — "current position" is not a slew target. The legacy `park_ra_ticks` / `park_dec_ticks` config keys remain as raw-encoder overrides for ops who pinned a specific tick pair; when both forms are set, the explicit tick pair wins. |
| `UnparkFromApPosition` | `park` (`ap_park_0..ap_park_5`) | Recovery operation. For `ap_park_0`, semantically equivalent to standard `Unpark()` — clears `AtPark`, no encoder change. For any named park (`ap_park_1..ap_park_5`), runs the [`ResetMountEncoders` sequence](#resetmountencoders-sequence) to safely write the park's encoder values *regardless of the current encoder state*, then clears `AtPark`. Operator is asserting "the OTA is physically at this park"; the driver makes firmware state match — this also **anchors the coordinate frame** and re-arms the park target (see [§Park lifecycle](#park-lifecycle)). |

Standard ASCOM `Unpark()` is unchanged — it always just clears the
`AtPark` flag with no encoder write. The two operations
(`Unpark()` and `UnparkFromApPosition(ap_park_0)`) are structurally
equivalent; the custom Action exists to express the recovery flow
for the named-park cases.

#### `ResetMountEncoders` sequence

Wraps the bare `:E1` / `:E2` writes in a safe-stop-then-seed envelope
so the operation works correctly regardless of in-flight firmware
state (pending `:G` goto, active `:I` tracking, latched `:M`
brakes):

```
:K1                          stop RA  (existing stop_axis_and_wait)
:K2                          stop Dec
poll :f1, :f2 until idle
:E1 <ra_ticks_for_park>      write seed encoder
:E2 <dec_ticks_for_park>     write seed encoder
clear driver-internal slew / target / tracking-flag state
```

Invoked by:

- `UnparkFromApPosition(ap_park_N)` for `N ≥ 1` (operator-confirmed
  physical position).
- Auto-seed path on fresh-power-up connect (the stop steps are no-ops
  in that state; the encoder writes are the only meaningful work).

Not invoked by the standard `Unpark()` flow — that path is for
"resume from where I parked," and writing the encoder there would
silently destroy session state.

#### Recovery procedures

What to do after various crash / disconnect scenarios:

| Scenario | Procedure |
|---|---|
| Driver crashed, mount still powered, OTA points at solvable sky | Reconnect (no power cycle) → `UnparkFromApPosition(ap_park_0)` (or standard `Unpark()`) → plate-solve current view → `SyncToCoordinates(plate_solved_coords)`. Encoder counter is intact from the session; sync writes the offset to match celestial truth. |
| Driver crashed, mount still powered, OTA points at unsolvable sky (below horizon, clouded out) | Reconnect → `UnparkFromApPosition(ap_park_N)` where `N` is the AP park you've physically positioned the OTA at. The `ResetMountEncoders` sequence stops in-flight motion and writes the park's encoder values; subsequent slews start from a known frame. Alternatively, power-cycle the mount and let the fresh-power-up auto-seed run from the persisted `unpark_from_ap_position` config value. |
| Mount lost power (planned shutdown or otherwise) | Before the next power-on, physically position the OTA at whatever `unpark_from_ap_position` is configured for (or update the config / call `SetUnparkFromApPosition` first). On power-on connect, the fresh-power-up auto-seed writes the encoder to that park's values. |

The only genuinely dangerous pattern is "crash + power-cycle without
re-parking AND with a non-`ap_park_0` `unpark_from_ap_position`
configured" — the auto-seed will fire against fresh-power-up encoder
and the driver will believe the OTA is at the configured park when
it's actually wherever the crash left it. The operator-discipline
mitigation is "if you power-cycle after a crash, physically re-park
first." A heavier mitigation (refusing `Unpark()` after fresh-seed
without an explicit operator confirmation gate) is deferred — opt-in
behind a future config flag if hardware sessions show it's needed.

### CLI arguments

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `-c, --config <PATH>` | Path to JSON config file |
| `--transport <usb\|udp>` | Override `transport.kind` |
| `--port <DEVICE_OR_HOST>` | Override `transport.port` (USB) or `transport.address` (UDP) |
| `--baud <RATE>` | Override `transport.baud_rate` (USB only) |
| `--server-port <PORT>` | Override `server.port` |
| `-l, --log-level <LEVEL>` | `trace` / `debug` / `info` / `warn` / `error` |
| `--service` | Hidden: run as a Windows service (passed by the Windows service control manager; no-op on other platforms) |

`star-adventurer-gti doctor [--config <file>] [--json]` diagnoses this
service's own config read-only without starting it — see
[doctor.md §Per-service doctors](doctor.md). Top-level flags cannot be
combined with the subcommand (the mixed form would silently ignore them).

### Config actions

The mount exposes its configuration over HTTP as the vendor ASCOM actions
`config.get` / `config.apply` / `config.schema` — the cross-driver protocol in
[`config-actions.md`](config-actions.md) — *alongside* its `SetPark` /
`*ApPark*` vendor actions (the `action()` dispatch tries the `ApParkAction` set
first, then falls through to the config actions). `config_actions.rs` supplies
the driver-specific half (`ConfigurableDriver for StarAdvDriver`).

- **Secret redacted / carried forward:** `/server/auth/password_hash`.
- **Locked (identity) field:** `mount.unique_id`.
- **Hard read-only fields:** the whole `transport` block (`transport.kind`,
  `.port`, `.address`, `.baud_rate`, `.command_timeout`, `.polling_interval` —
  the `usb`/`udp` enum is best edited in the config file), `server.port`, and
  `mount.enabled`.
- **Overrides:** `Overrides = ()`. The CLI overrides (`--transport`/`--port`/
  `--baud`/`--server-port`) all target read-only fields, so there is nothing to
  override-pin; the read-only tier is the practical equivalent.

The mount's parse-don't-validate config types self-validate at deserialize, so a
malformed submission fails with `INVALID_VALUE` before `validate` runs; the only
`status:"invalid"` path is an empty `mount.unique_id`. A `config.apply` that
changes a field persists atomically, returns `status:"applying"`, and fires the
in-process reload: `main.rs` runs under
`ServiceRunner::with_reload().run_with_reload(...)`, whose loop re-reads + re-
applies the CLI overrides and rebuilds the server from the freshly-persisted file.

## Testing

The strategy follows
[`docs/skills/testing.md`](../skills/testing.md): BDD scenarios are the
canonical contract; unit tests cover protocol parsing and coordinate math;
ConformU verifies ASCOM compliance.

| Layer | Coverage |
|---|---|
| Crate unit tests (`#[cfg(test)]`) | command/response encode-decode, codec edge cases (0x000000, 0xFFFFFF, signed boundaries), error parsing, frame framing rules |
| Crate property tests (`tests/property_tests.rs`) | round-trip: random `Command` → bytes → `Command`; same for `Response`; bias-offset preservation across signed `i32` range |
| Service unit tests (`#[cfg(test)]` per module) | `coordinates`: encoder ↔ RA/Dec across edge cases (poles, meridian, hemisphere flip); `config`: defaults, JSON round-trips, CLI overrides; `error`: ASCOM mapping |
| Service BDD (cucumber) | every behaviour table-row above as a scenario, with the mock transport |
| Service `test_lib.rs` (gated on `mock`) | server starts, binds the configured port, exposes the configured device |
| `conformu_integration.rs` (gated on `conformu`) | ASCOM Telescope compliance via `ConformUTestBuilder::run()` — runs both `alpacaprotocol` and `conformance` phases. **Currently NOT wired into the nightly `conformu` workflow** (issue #201): three independent conformance-phase failures need driver work first. See [§"Running ConformU manually"](#running-conformu-manually) and [§"Expected ConformU report"](#expected-conformu-report). |

The mock transport is a feature-gated in-memory state machine that
simulates the motor controller — it accepts the same `:cmd<axis>...\r`
frames and emits well-formed `=...\r` / `!XX\r` responses, with internal
state for axis position, motion mode, running/stopped, and tracking. In
**tracking mode** the mock advances the axis encoder forward by a small
sidereal-equivalent chunk per `:j` poll (ignoring `goto_target_ticks`),
so post-slew `RA` reads stay constant — matching what real Sky-Watcher
firmware does once tracking is re-enabled. In **goto mode** the mock
walks toward `goto_target_ticks` and clears `running` on arrival. BDD
tests use the mock by default; ConformU and `test_lib.rs` use the
feature-gated mock so the binary itself runs against a fake mount.

### Running ConformU manually

This service is deliberately **not** in the nightly `conformu`
workflow rotation (issue #201). `ConformUTestBuilder::run()` (which
the in-tree integration test uses) runs `alpacaprotocol` then
`conformance`. With PulseGuide landed (PR #206), the
`alpacaprotocol` phase now completes — but the `conformance` phase
surfaces three independent failures that need driver work before
re-adding `[package.metadata.conformu]` to the package's
`Cargo.toml`:

1. **`SideOfPierTests` aborts CheckMethods.** ConformU
   (`TelescopeTester.cs::SopPierTest`) slews to mechanical-HA
   ±9 h to verify pier-side reporting on both sides of the
   meridian. The `[-6.95, +6.95]` h safety envelope correctly
   rejects those slews on real hardware, but the
   `InvalidValueException` is caught by ConformU's
   "Exception when testing device" handler at CheckMethods scope
   and the rest of the suite is abandoned — so the CI test exits
   with one ISSUE and no further diagnostics. Widening the
   envelope just for the mock test config (e.g.
   `ra_min_hours = -12`, `ra_max_hours = 12`) lets CheckMethods
   complete and exposes the other two failures below.
2. **`SideOfPier` returns `pierWest` for every in-envelope
   target.** `coordinates::side_of_pier` keys on
   `|dec_ticks| > cpr_dec/4` (the Dec-encoder-past-pole
   "physical flip" convention). Inside the safety envelope the
   Dec encoder never crosses that threshold, so the driver
   reports `West` regardless of which side of the meridian the
   mount is observing. ConformU asserts the ASCOM pointing-state
   convention (`pierWest` for HA ∈ [-6, 0), `pierEast` for
   HA ∈ (0, +6]) and records ISSUEs for every HA > 0 case in
   both `SideofPier` and `DestinationSideofPier`.
3. **PulseGuide rate-shifted tracking produces the wrong
   motion on every axis.** ConformU's PulseGuide tolerance
   check expects `guide_rate × sidereal × duration` of motion
   on the pulsed axis and ~0 on the other. The driver fails
   the check in all four directions across HA ±3 and ±9
   (24 ISSUEs total): Dec North/South moves at ~2× the
   configured rate (71.4″ vs 37.6″ expected for a 5 s pulse at
   the default 0.5× sidereal rate); RA East slows by only ~10 %
   instead of the configured 50 % (Δ RA 0.48 s vs 2.51 s
   expected); and RA West pulses move east (Δ RA +0.48 s where
   ConformU expects −2.51 s). The implementation is the
   rate-shifted tracking burst PR #206 introduced, not a
   Dec-vs-encoder coordinate issue.

To reproduce locally, run the in-tree integration test — same
binary, same config, same ConformU invocation the workflow used:

```bash
bazel test //services/star-adventurer-gti:conformu_integration
```

The test config (`tests/conformu_integration.rs`) sets
`site_latitude_deg = 47.6062` so ConformU's
`SIDE_OF_PIER_INVALID_LATITUDE = 10°` gate does not skip the
side-of-pier model tests.

### Expected ConformU report

These are the conformance-phase findings against the current
driver (PR #206). They are *not* a green run — fixing (2) and (3)
above is on the roadmap before the package is re-added to the
nightly workflow.

After (1) is worked around by widening the mock test envelope:

- **0 errors** — anything here is a real driver regression.
- **~58 issues**, dominated by:
  - PulseGuide tolerance failures at HA ±3 and ±9 in all four
    directions (24 entries) — driver bug (3). Each pulsed-axis
    "Moved {N,S,E,W} but outside test tolerance" row counts
    once, and each accompanying "{East-West,North-South}
    movement was outside test tolerance" row (the axis the
    pulse is *not* supposed to move) counts once.
  - `SideofPier` and `DestinationSideofPier`
    "`pierWest` is returned when the mount is observing at an
    hour angle between 0.0 and +6.0" (8 entries) — driver
    bug (2). ConformU's `SideofPier` test assumes a
    flip-at-meridian GEM (EQMOD / Sky-Watcher Synscan /
    ASCOM-driver-pattern behaviour) and expects `pierEast`
    for any target west of the meridian; the driver returns
    `pierWest` everywhere because the safety envelope keeps
    the Dec encoder within `[-CPR/4, +CPR/4]` and
    `coordinates::side_of_pier` only flips when that bound is
    crossed.
  - `SideofPier` / `DestinationSideofPier`
    "reports physical pier side rather than pointing state"
    and "Same value … on both sides of the meridian"
    (4 entries) — same root cause as bug (2): a non-flipping
    mount lands every in-envelope target in the same
    pointing state.

Historical baselines (`alpacaprotocol`-only or partial
`conformance` runs):

- Pre-#202 baseline (HA-meridian split, `DestinationSideOfPier`
  unimplemented): 9 issues — `DestinationSideOfPier` ×1
  (NotImplemented), `SOPPierTest` ×4 (inherited from
  NotImplemented), `SOPPierTest` ×2 (safety envelope),
  `TrackingRate Write` ×2 (upstream `ascom-alpaca-rs`
  framework bug — Alpaca enum rejection at the axum/serde
  layer before reaching the driver).
- Post-#202 baseline (Dec-encoder split, `DestinationSideOfPier`
  implemented, PulseGuide not yet landed, conformance never
  reached SideOfPierTests because alpacaprotocol failed on
  `IsPulseGuiding`): 7 issues as previously documented.

## Connection Lifecycle

The transport's lifetime is tied to the **service** lifetime, not to ASCOM
`Connected`. The driver runs `rusty-photon-shared-transport` in its
`ServiceLifetime` mode: the port opens eagerly at startup (so a wrong-device
or unreachable mount fails the process *before* it advertises on the
network) and stays open — kept alive across transient drops by the reconnect
supervisor — until the service shuts down. ASCOM `Connected = true` / `false`
only acquires / releases a session on the already-open transport. See
[`docs/plans/archive/eager-hardware-validation.md`](../plans/archive/eager-hardware-validation.md)
for the rationale.

```
Service start (`ServerBuilder::build()` → `SharedTransport::start()`,
               before the HTTP listener binds)
   ↓
open transport (serial: tokio-serial open + raw mode;
                UDP: bind to config.bind_address, set timeout)
   ↓
init handshake:
  :e1               (motor board version)  → identity gate +
                                              mount-type whitelist
                                              (issue #254);
                                              wrong-device handshake
                                              stops here → build() errors
                                              and the process exits
                                              non-zero before binding
                                              the listener.
  :F1, :F2          (initialize axes)
  :a1, :a2          (CPR per axis)         → cache
  :b1               (TMR_Freq)             → cache
  :g1, :g2          (high-speed ratio)     → cache
  :j1, :j2          (initial positions)    → cache + snapshot
   ↓
start background polling task (interval = config.polling_interval)
```

```
Connected = true   → acquire a session (refcount bump; the transport is
                     already open and polling — no wire handshake here),
                     then the post-acquire hooks run in order:
  1. seed_after_connect — if unpark_from_ap_position ∈ ap_park_1..ap_park_5
       AND the firmware encoder is within FRESH_POWER_UP_TICK_TOLERANCE of
       (0, 0):  :E1, :E2  (seed encoder to the AP pose's codebase convention)
  2. load_park_target_after_connect — resolve the in-memory park ticks:
       raw config override per axis, else preferred_ap_park pose ticks when
       the frame is anchored (named unpark_from_ap_position), else no target
       (Park stops in place) — see §Park lifecycle

Connected = false  → release the session. On the last client disconnect the
                     on_last_disconnect hook runs :L1, :L2, :K1 (safety
                     stop); the transport stays open, background polling
                     continues, and the parameter cache is retained.
```

```
Service shutdown (HTTP server stops → `SharedTransport::shutdown()`)
   ↓
shutdown hook runs :L1, :L2, :K1 one last time
   ↓
cancel the reconnect supervisor + the polling task
   ↓
close transport
   ↓
clear parameter cache
```

Multiple Alpaca clients share the one open transport (refcount); a client
disconnect no longer closes the port — that happens only at service
shutdown. A transient transport drop is handled by the reconnect supervisor,
which re-runs the handshake against the new connection while live sessions
survive via the connection-cell swap. (Same service-lifetime pattern as
`qhy-focuser`, `ppba-driver`, `pa-falcon-rotator`, and `dsd-fp2`.)

## MVP Scope

### Phase status

| Phase | Status |
|---|---|
| **Phase 1 — Design doc** | ✓ landed (this document, PR #178) |
| **Phase 2 — BDD scaffold** | ✓ landed: codec crate skeleton, service skeleton, all feature files (`@wip`), step stubs (PR #180) |
| **Phase 3 — Implementation** | ✓ landed: codec, transports (USB+UDP), `MountDevice`, ConformU integration (PR #188); BDD step bodies + `@wip` removal (PR #189). All 9 feature files / 77 scenarios green on Linux/Windows/macOS CI. |
| **Phase 4 — Real-hardware bringup** | partially landed — first hardware connect surfaced several protocol-decoding gaps that the mock had hidden. Details below. |
| **Phase A5 — `:I`/`:M` on slew + EQMOD pickup** | landed (issue #205) — reinstates `:I` on the slew path, switches goto to `:H` (delta target) + `:M` (break-point), and adds an iterative post-stop pickup loop to close the residual RA drift the Phase 4 ConformU run flagged. |
| **Phase A6 — Dec-encoder `SideOfPier` + `DestinationSideOfPier`** | landed (issue #202) — switches `SideOfPier` from the RA mech-HA split at `HA = 0` to the canonical INDI eqmod Dec-encoder convention (`East` when `\|dec_encoder\| > cpr_dec/4`), and lands `DestinationSideOfPier` reusing the same coordinate-math pipeline as `SlewToCoordinatesAsync`. ConformU expected-issues count moves from 9 to 7: the `DestinationSideOfPier` NotImplemented entry and the four inherited `SOPPierTest` entries clear, the two upstream `TrackingRate Write` entries disappear (unrelated framework fix), and three new "non-flipping mount" entries appear that reflect ConformU's flip-aware-GEM assumption rather than driver bugs. See [§Expected ConformU report](#expected-conformu-report). |
| **Phase A7 — PulseGuide** | landed (issue #206) — implements `PulseGuide` as a rate-shifted tracking burst on the targeted axis (no `:P`; that's the ST4-jack rate setter, not a pulse trigger), flips `CanPulseGuide` and `CanSetGuideRates` to `true`. Re-enabled `[package.metadata.conformu]` so the full two-phase ConformU integration ran again — but the `conformance` phase, which `alpacaprotocol`-only manual runs hadn't exercised, surfaced three failures that PR #206's review hadn't caught; see Phase A8. |
| **Phase A8 — Nightly ConformU opt-out (#201)** | landed (issue #201) — removed `[package.metadata.conformu]` again. ConformU's `conformance` phase fails for three independent reasons that need driver work first: (a) `SideOfPierTests` slews to mech-HA ±9 h, which the safety envelope correctly rejects on hardware but which ConformU treats as a fatal CheckMethods-level exception that abandons the rest of the suite; (b) `SideOfPier` always returns `pierWest` for in-envelope targets (Dec-encoder convention) where ConformU asserts the ASCOM pointing-state convention; (c) PulseGuide Dec moves at full sidereal rate instead of `guide_rate_dec_fraction × sidereal`. See [§Running ConformU manually](#running-conformu-manually) and [§Expected ConformU report](#expected-conformu-report) for the failure details and reproduction steps. |
| **Phase 5 — user-defined `SetPark` + persistence** | landed (issue #203) — park target now sourced from `mount.park_ra_ticks` / `mount.park_dec_ticks` in the config (fallback: encoder positions captured at handshake), `SetPark` writes the current encoder pair back into the running config file via atomic rename, `CanSetPark` flips on when `--config` is provided. See [§Park lifecycle](#park-lifecycle) and [§Park persistence](#park-persistence). |
| **Phase 6 — meridian-flip support** | hardware-validated 2026-05-16 (lat 32.7°N) — adds `MountConfig::flip_policy` (`enabled` + `flip_range_hours`), the asymmetric CW exclusion zone safety envelope, CW-exclusion zone-path-aware through-wrap RA routing, visible-pole Dec routing, `SetSideOfPier`, and flip-aware `DestinationSideOfPier`. End-to-end AP Park 1–5 traversal (including the through-wrap saddle-east flip and its flip-back) ran clean; the flip-back from the saddle-east wrap caught a sign-blind heuristic in `flip_slew_ra_delta` that the path-aware check now handles. `flip_policy.enabled` still defaults `false` (operators opt in once they've replayed the validation locally). The tracking-time CW-exclusion-zone safety guard (Part 1 of issue #259) has since landed — a background watcher stops tracking before the encoder `mech_HA` drifts into the zone (see [§Tracking-time safety guard](#tracking-time-safety-guard)). Driver-planned auto-flip-during-tracking (Phase 2.5 / Part 2 of #259) has since landed as well — the same watcher can start a standard flip on the operator's behalf once tracking carries `mech_HA` past a configured offset, opt-in via `flip_policy.auto_flip_during_tracking` and pending its own real-hardware validation (see [§Auto-flip during tracking](#auto-flip-during-tracking)). Plan: [`docs/plans/star-adventurer-gti-meridian-flip.md`](../plans/star-adventurer-gti-meridian-flip.md). See [§Meridian flip](#meridian-flip). |
| **Phase 7 — altitude-based safety floor (#223)** | landed 2026-07-01 ("Phase 3" in the plan's local numbering) — replaces the rectangular celestial-Dec envelope (`dec_limits`) with `MountConfig::min_altitude_degrees`: slew / sync targets whose computed apparent altitude (`sin alt = sin lat · sin dec + cos lat · cos dec · cos HA`) is below the floor are rejected with `INVALID_VALUE`. Default `0.0` (geometric horizon); negative floors permit below-horizon pointing and log `info!` at startup. `Park` stays exempt (privileged-park pattern). See [§Altitude floor](#altitude-floor). |

#### Phase 4 findings (hardware bringup)

First connecting the driver to a physical Star Adventurer GTi
revealed four wire-protocol issues the mock had not been
exercising. All are now patched, with regression tests in the
protocol crate and the BDD suite.

1. **`:g<axis>` payload width.** The spec is ambiguous about
   payload width for `Inquire High-Speed Ratio`. Real GTi returns
   a **2-hex-byte** payload (`=01\r`) on both axes — not the
   6-hex-byte u24 that the codec originally assumed. The codec
   now accepts both widths; the value (`0x01`) is stored as a
   plain `u32` in the parameter cache. Note that the documented
   "16, 32, 64" expected high-speed-ratio values do **not** match
   what this firmware returns. The driver no longer relies on
   the high-speed-ratio for slew-rate computation — see point 3.

2. **`!XX\r` error frame width.** Spec §4 documents a 2-hex-digit
   error code; empirical GTi returns a **1-hex-digit** form
   (`!4\r`) for the single-digit codes defined in §5. The codec
   accepts both 3- and 4-byte error frames.

3. **`:G` mode-byte semantics — most damaging bug.** The `:G`
   payload is **two independent hex nibbles** (DB1 then DB2 per
   spec §5), each with its own bit assignments. The original
   codec treated the byte as a flat 8-bit bitfield with
   `goto = 0x10, fast = 0x20, reverse = 0x01`. By coincidence the
   wire bytes it produced for `GOTO_FAST_FORWARD` (`"30"`) decode
   under the spec as **Tracking-Fast-CW**, which never auto-stops
   at the `:S` target. Every slew the driver issued was
   effectively a continuous-step command. The codec was rewritten
   to encode each nibble correctly:
   - `MotionMode::TRACKING` → wire `"10"` (DB1=1 Tracking, DB2=0 CW)
   - `MotionMode::GOTO_FAST_FORWARD` → wire `"00"` (DB1=0 Goto+Fast, DB2=0 CW)
   - Reverse direction flips DB2 bit 0 (e.g. `"01"` / `"11"`).

4. **`:f` status nibble-0 bit-1** decoded as "Forward" in the
   original codec. Per spec it is **CCW**. Renamed
   `AxisStatus.forward` → `AxisStatus.ccw`; `AxisStatus.blocked`
   and `AxisStatus.level_switch_on` (spec nibble-1 bit-1 and
   nibble-2 bit-1, respectively) added at the same time. The
   slew watcher now aborts on `blocked`.

#### Phase 4 driver-logic changes that real hardware required

In addition to the codec fixes:

- **`stop_and_wait`** — `:K` (decelerate) only *requests* a stop;
  the motor takes meaningful wallclock time to actually halt.
  `:G` against a still-decelerating axis returns `!2\r`
  (`MotorNotStopped`). The slew, park, and `set_tracking(true)`
  paths issue `:K` (decelerate) and then poll `:f` until
  `running == false`, before any subsequent `:G`/`:S`/`:J`. An
  early version of this path used `:L` (instant stop) instead;
  switched to `:K` in issue #207 to match the spec's recommended
  stop semantics and INDI eqmod's `StopWaitMotor`
  (`indi-eqmod/skywatcher.cpp:1741-1765`) — `:L` is harsher on
  the gearbox and is reserved for genuine emergency stops
  (`AbortSlew`, slew/park watcher abort on `blocked`).
  Mock hid the wallclock issue originally because it processes
  `:K`/`:L` instantaneously.
- **No mode-cache short-circuit (attempted and reverted)** — issue
  #207's initial plan included an INDI-style
  `LastRunningStatus == NewStatus` cache to skip `stop_and_wait +
  :G` when the requested mode matched the last one we acked. **The
  implementation we tried did not work on real hardware.**
  Mock-mode ConformU + the unit/BDD suites all passed cleanly, but
  the first ConformU run against the physical GTi triggered an
  unbounded Dec slew: the cache said `Goto-Fast-CCW` after a `:E`
  (sync), but the firmware-side mode had drifted; the resulting
  `:I/:H/:M/:J` started a slew that ran ~360° of unwanted Dec
  motion before the pickup loop fired a ~269° corrective slew back.
  See PR #210 for the wire trace. The cache was reverted to an
  unconditional `stop_and_wait + :G` on every slew/park/tracking
  prep — the spec-recommended sequence and what INDI's
  `StopWaitMotor` does internally.

  Two reasons not to retry naively if/when revisiting:

  1. **`:E` (sync) is one observed mode-state desync, but not
     necessarily the only one.** Tracking transitions, post-goto
     auto-engage on RA, `:L` aborts, blocked-axis recovery, and any
     other state-changing command can shift firmware-side mode
     without an explicit `:G` from us. A cache that mirrors only
     what we *issued* is structurally unsafe.
  2. **UDP transport widens the failure mode.** The wire protocol
     is identical on USB-CDC and UDP/11880, but UDP can drop,
     reorder, or duplicate packets without us noticing; a cache
     that records "we sent `:G CCW` and saw an ack" can lie even
     more easily if a `:G` response was actually a stale duplicate
     ack from a prior frame. Anything we cache about firmware state
     must survive both half of the codec layer being lossy.

  Any future cache implementation needs a **background validation
  loop** that re-reads the actual `:f` mode bits (per spec §5, the
  status nibble reports the live mode) often enough to catch
  desyncs *before* the next `:G`-eliding op fires — polling cadence
  needs to be comparable to or faster than the smallest slew a
  caller could chain, and a desync detection must invalidate the
  per-axis cache immediately and refuse short-circuits until the
  next confirmed `:G` ack. Without that — or without a different
  approach that doesn't depend on a snapshot of state we don't own —
  the cache is structurally unsound.
- **INDI-style slew sequence** — Phase A5 reinstated `:I` on the
  slew path and switched the goto from `:S` (absolute target) to
  `:H` (delta target) plus `:M` (break-point increment), matching
  what `indi-eqmod`'s `SlewTo` emits. The spec §3 phrasing that
  "the firmware picks goto speed internally" turned out to be
  half the story: the firmware does, but only when `:I` has
  primed `minperiods[axis]` (INDI defaults to `6`). Without it
  the goto runs at a slower step period and the deceleration
  ramp set by `:M breaks = min(|delta|/10, 3200)` is missing,
  which is what produced the post-stop residual RA drift the
  Phase 4 ConformU run flagged. Park still uses `:S` since its
  target is encoder 0 and the absolute form is the simpler fit.
- **Pickup-loop accuracy stack** — issue #207 follow-up; three
  layered fixes that together brought real-hardware ConformU
  residuals from mean 8.4″ / max 11.0″ (2 × 10″ tolerance
  crossings) down to mean 2.4″ / max 6.6″ on USB and mean 5.0″ /
  max 8.7″ on UDP, with **zero crossings on either transport**.

  1. **LST pre-compensation** —
     [`coordinates::pickup_target_ra_ticks`] computes each
     iteration's corrective encoder target for `LST(now +
     projection)` rather than `LST(now)`. Without it the slew
     lands at where the target *was* one iteration ago, and the
     residual floor matches the per-iteration LST drift (~6″ on
     USB, ~14″ on UDP).

  2. **Adaptive projection** — the watcher tracks the wall-clock
     interval between consecutive pickup decisions and uses it as
     the projection for the next iteration. Self-tunes per
     transport without per-transport config: USB iterations
     stabilise at ~400 ms, UDP at ~1100 ms. First iteration (no
     prior data) falls back to `polling_interval × 2`.

  3. **Pause background polling during the slew** — the watcher
     acquires a [`MountManager::pause_background_polling`]
     RAII guard at the top of its spawn. While paused, the
     watcher owns the wire: pickup wire commands (`:K :G :I :H
     :M :J`) fire without contending with `:j` / `:f` polls for
     the shared-transport command lock, and the watcher's
     [`MountManager::poll_axes_now`] drives the snapshot's
     freshness with one wire round-trip per loop iteration. The
     guard is advisory rather than synchronous: it bumps a depth
     counter that the poll loop reads once per iteration, at the
     top, so a poll cycle already past that read runs to
     completion and can still put a full cycle of `:j` / `:f`
     frames on the wire after the guard is taken. That is harmless —
     the shared-transport command lock serialises them against
     the watcher's own commands, and the guard exists to shed
     wire load, not to provide mutual exclusion. The
     guard is dropped explicitly right after tracking restart,
     before the settle delay — so background polling resumes
     during settle and the snapshot reflects the actively-tracking
     encoder position by the time an Alpaca client reads
     `RightAscension` post-`Slewing`. Releasing the guard early
     vs. on watcher exit makes a measurable difference (UDP mean
     7.3″ → 5.0″ in the experiment runs). Park watcher follows
     the same pattern.

  See `docs/plans/archive/star-adventurer-gti-pickup-accuracy.md` for the
  experiment plan and the diagnostic data that drove these
  choices.
- **Mechanical safety envelope** — driving the mount into the
  counterweight-up region with ConformU's pier-flip tests stalled
  the motor against a hard stop while the encoder counter kept
  advancing (audible motor noise, OTA stationary). `MountConfig`
  carries the asymmetric mech_HA interval where the CW binds against
  the pier (`cw_exclusion_zone`) plus the apparent-altitude floor
  (`min_altitude_degrees`, which replaced the rectangular `dec_limits`
  envelope 2026-07-01) —
  both wrapped as validated newtypes per
  [ADR-006](../decisions/006-typed-physical-quantities-for-mount-pointing.md).
  `SyncToCoordinates` and
  `SlewToCoordinatesAsync` reject targets whose chosen-side
  `mech_HA` falls inside the CW exclusion zone with `INVALID_VALUE`
  before any wire motion; `Park` writes the target encoder ticks
  directly without the CW-exclusion zone check, matching INDI EQMOD's
  privileged-park pattern. Pre-Phase-6 builds used a symmetric
  natural-side window (`ra_min_hours` / `ra_max_hours`); that's
  been replaced by the asymmetric CW-exclusion zone interval because
  the actual GEM hazard is one-sided.
  Defaults: CW exclusion zone `(0.95, 11.05) h` of mech_HA — the
  one-sided arc where the CW shaft rises more than 0.95 h above
  horizontal on the GTi (the symmetric `±6.99 h` natural-side
  bound from the 2026-05-13 test is *subsumed* by the new
  asymmetric model: tracking past `+0.95 h` enters the zone and is
  refused, while reaching `−12 h` for anti-meridian poses like
  Park 1 is no longer blocked). A narrower `(6.95, 11.05)` was
  used before 2026-05-17 but missed the ascending half of the
  CW exclusion arc — see
  [§Safety envelope](#safety-envelope-cw-exclusion-zone)
  for the hardware session that triggered the widening. Altitude
  floor `0°` (geometric horizon) — see [§Altitude floor](#altitude-floor).
- **Slew watcher abort on `:f` blocked** — both the slew and
  park completion watchers issue `:L` on both axes and clear
  `slew_in_progress` if either axis reports `blocked=true`.
- **Transient-error tolerance with best-effort halt** — the
  slew/park watchers tolerate up to three consecutive
  `poll_axes_now` failures (with a 100 ms backoff between
  attempts) before giving up, so a single USB-CDC glitch
  doesn't take the watcher offline for the rest of a goto.
  On retry exhaustion the helper fires `:L` on both axes
  best-effort so the motor isn't left commutating with no
  observer, then clears `slew_in_progress` and exits.
  Every successful poll is also emitted at `debug` with the
  full per-axis snapshot (position, running, blocked, goto)
  so post-mortems can reconstruct the last-known-good state
  observed before any failure. See
  `mount_device::watcher_poll_with_retry`.
- **EQMOD-style iterative pickup** — Phase A5 added a pickup
  loop in the slew watcher: after both axes report stopped,
  the watcher reads current RA/Dec, compares against the
  latched target, and if either residual exceeds 5″ (matching
  INDI's `RAGOTORESOLUTION`/`DEGOTORESOLUTION`) recomputes the
  delta for the current LST and re-enters the wire sequence.
  Capped at 5 iterations (`GOTO_ITERATIVE_LIMIT`). On the GTi
  this converges in 1–2 iterations because the post-stop
  residual is bounded by `slew_duration × sidereal_rate` and
  the second pass starts from a near-zero delta.

What's still outstanding from Phase 4:

- **Empirical slew rate vs `:g`** — the formal high-speed-ratio
  formula in spec §3 gives `1` for `hsr = 1` (sidereal rate),
  which is unusable. The firmware appears to pick its own
  Goto-mode rate (~5°/s observed). Documented; revisit if a
  tunable goto rate becomes a requirement.

### Deferred (not in MVP)

| Capability | Why deferred |
|---|---|
| `MoveAxis`, `CanMoveAxis(*)` | manual hand-paddle-style slew rates; not needed by `rp`; deferred along with custom tracking rates |
| `SlewToAltAz*`, `SyncToAltAz`, `CanSlewAltAz*` | RA/Dec coverage is sufficient for `rp`'s tools; Alt/Az slew is a separate path through the coordinate module |
| `RightAscensionRate`, `DeclinationRate` setters | custom-rate tracking; not needed for sidereal-only MVP |
| `TrackingRate` setter (lunar / solar / king) | sidereal covers astrophotography; lunar/solar are uncommon and add a small mode-switch matrix |
| `FindHome`, `CanFindHome` | no hardware home sensor on the GTi |
| Operator-confirmation gate on `Unpark()` after fresh-power-up seed | Hardware-discipline mitigation for the "crash + power-cycle without re-park" failure mode. Today's design relies on operator discipline ("if you power-cycle after a crash, physically re-park first"); a confirmation gate is the heavier alternative. Deferred behind a future config flag, to be added if hardware sessions show the discipline assumption breaks. |
| Polar-alignment helpers, TPOINT, cone error | observational pointing model is the host's concern, not the driver's |
| WiFi station mode (mount on a routed network) | AP-mode UDP is verified; station mode just changes the bind-address selection — straightforward to add once a station-mode test setup exists |
| Multi-mount support on a single binary | `rp` assumes one mount per service; multi-mount is a separate concern |

### Misleading and explicitly out-of-scope

The Sky-Watcher developer downloads page hosts two other protocol PDFs
that look superficially relevant but are *not* applicable to the GTi USB
or WiFi connection — recording here so future readers don't fall into
the same trap:

- [SynScan v3.3 hand-control protocol](https://inter-static.skywatcher.com/downloads/synscanserialcommunicationprotocol_version33.pdf)
  — describes commands the SynScan **hand controller** accepts on its
  RS-232 port at 9600 baud (single-char ASCII, `#`-terminated, J2000
  RA/Dec). The GTi has no hand controller and its USB / WiFi do not
  speak this protocol. Empirically verified.
- [SynScan App Protocol](https://inter-static.skywatcher.com/downloads/synscan_app_protocol_20250930.pdf)
  — describes a remote-control protocol for the **SynScan app itself**
  (third-party software → SynScan app on phone/desktop → mount on
  UDP/TCP 11881). Useless as a direct-to-mount protocol because it
  requires SynScan app as a middleman.
